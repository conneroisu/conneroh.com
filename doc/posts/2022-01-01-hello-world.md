# Getting Started with Go

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It's known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrency.

## Installation

First, download and install Go from the [official website](https://golang.org/dl/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Setting Up Your Workspace

Go uses a unique workspace structure. The standard way to organize your Go code is:

```
├── bin/
├── pkg/
└── src/
    └── github.com/
        └── yourusername/
            └── yourproject/
```

## Your First Go Program

Create a file named `hello.go` with the following content:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Run it with:

```
go run hello.go
```

## Basic Concepts

### Variables and Types

Go is statically typed. You can declare variables using `var` or with the short declaration syntax `:=`.

```go
var name string = "John"
age := 30 // Type inferred as int
```

### Functions

Functions in Go can return multiple values:

```go
func divide(a, b float64) (float64, error) {
    if b == 0 {
        return 0, errors.New("cannot divide by zero")
    }
    return a / b, nil
}
```

### Control Structures

Go includes familiar control structures like if/else, for loops, and switch statements.

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore:

1. Structs and interfaces
2. Concurrency with goroutines and channels
3. The standard library
4. Building web applications

Happy coding!
