# Data Structures

**Data structures** are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services.

Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs.
