# Systems Engineering

Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary approach to designing and managing complex systems throughout their life cycles. In the context of hardware and control systems, it involves the integration of electrical, mechanical, and software components to create cohesive industrial automation solutions.

This includes work with PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), HMIs (Human Machine Interfaces), and other control systems used in manufacturing and industrial applications.
