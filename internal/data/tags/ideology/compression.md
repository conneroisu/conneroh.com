Data compression is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. It involves various algorithms and techniques to reduce data size while maintaining the ability to reconstruct the original data either perfectly (lossless) or approximately (lossy).

Compression is essential for efficient data storage, faster transmission over networks, and reduced bandwidth usage. Common applications include file archiving, media streaming, and database optimization.
