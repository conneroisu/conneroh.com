LZMA (Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain Algorithm) is a lossless data compression algorithm that uses a dictionary compression scheme with larger dictionary sizes and special support for match distances.

Developed by Igor Pavlov and first used in 7-Zip archiver, LZMA provides high compression ratios and variable compression-dictionary sizes, making it suitable for applications where high compression is more important than speed.

The algorithm features excellent compression ratio, moderate memory requirements during compression, fast decompression, and support for multi-threading. It's widely used in software distribution, embedded systems, and archival storage.
