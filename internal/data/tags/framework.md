Software frameworks are collections of libraries, tools, and conventions that provide a foundation for building applications. They offer pre-written code, established patterns, and architectural guidelines that help developers build software more efficiently and consistently.

Frameworks exist for various purposes including web development, mobile apps, desktop applications, game development, and data science. They abstract common functionality, enforce best practices, and allow developers to focus on application-specific logic rather than reinventing foundational components.
