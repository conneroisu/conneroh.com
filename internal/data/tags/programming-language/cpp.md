# C++

C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose programming language developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** in the early 1980s as an extension of C, incorporating object-oriented features while maintaining efficiency and low-level control.

Over the years, it has evolved with modern standards like C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20, enhancing safety, usability, and performance.
