Lua is a lightweight, high-level, and embeddable scripting language designed for flexibility and efficiency. Created in 1993 by a team at PUC-Rio in Brazil, Lua is known for its simple syntax, fast execution speed, and ease of integration with other languages, making it widely used in game development, embedded systems, and scripting applications. It features dynamic typing, automatic memory management via garbage collection, and a powerful table-based data structure that supports object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. Lua is often embedded in larger software applications, such as game engines like Unity and Corona, as well as networking and automation tools. Its small footprint and performance efficiency make it a popular choice for applications requiring fast execution and low resource consumption.
