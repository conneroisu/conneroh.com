Zsh (Z shell) is a Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a command interpreter for shell scripting. It is an extended Bourne shell with many improvements, including features from bash, ksh, and tcsh.

Key features include powerful tab completion, spell correction, programmable command-line completion, shared command history, improved array handling, and extensive customization through themes and plugins. Zsh is particularly popular among developers for its flexibility and the Oh My Zsh framework.
