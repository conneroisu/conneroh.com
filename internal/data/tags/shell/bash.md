Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a Unix shell and command language written as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. Developed by the GNU Project, it has been the default shell for most Linux distributions and macOS (until Catalina).

Bash incorporates features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh), including command line editing, command history, directory stack, job control, shell functions and aliases, and arrays. It's widely used for both interactive use and shell scripting, offering excellent compatibility with sh scripts while providing numerous extensions.
