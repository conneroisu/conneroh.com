Fish (Friendly Interactive Shell) is a Unix shell designed to be user-friendly and interactive. It aims to be more intuitive than traditional shells while maintaining powerful features for advanced users.

Notable features include syntax highlighting, autosuggestions based on history, tab completions that parse man pages, web-based configuration, and sane scripting with proper error messages. Fish breaks compatibility with POSIX shell syntax in favor of a cleaner, more consistent language that's easier to learn and use.
