Nushell (Nu) is a modern shell that brings structured data and functional programming concepts to the command line. Written in Rust, it treats data as structured tables rather than raw text, enabling powerful data manipulation and querying capabilities.

Key features include built-in data parsing for various formats (JSON, CSV, TOML, etc.), SQL-like query syntax, type checking, cross-platform support, and a plugin system. Nushell revolutionizes shell scripting by making it easier to work with structured data, similar to how you might work with data in Python or R.
