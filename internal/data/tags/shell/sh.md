The Bourne shell (sh) is the original Unix shell developed by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs in 1979. It serves as the foundation for the POSIX shell standard and remains the most portable shell across Unix-like systems.

As the standard shell for scripts, sh provides basic but powerful features including command substitution, piping, I/O redirection, and control structures. While it lacks many interactive features of modern shells, its ubiquity and standardization make it the preferred choice for portable shell scripts.
