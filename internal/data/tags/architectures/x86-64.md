# x86-64

x86 is a family of instruction set architectures (ISA) that originated with Intel's 8086 microprocessor in 1978. It has since become one of the most widely used CPU architectures in the world. Here's an overview of what x86 is:

## Key Characteristics

- Evolution: Started with the 16-bit 8086 processor, evolved to 32-bit (often called x86 or IA-32) with the 80386 in 1985, and further to 64-bit (x86-64 or AMD64) introduced by AMD in 2003.
- CISC Architecture: Uses a Complex Instruction Set Computing design, meaning it has many specialized instructions of varying complexity and length.
- Backward Compatibility: Newer x86 processors maintain compatibility with software written for earlier versions, which has contributed to its longevity and widespread adoption.
- Register-Based: Uses a set of registers for computation, with the register set expanding as the architecture evolved from 16 to 32 to 64 bits.

## Notable Features

- Memory Segmentation: Originally used a segmented memory model, though modern usage relies more on flat memory addressing.
- Protection Rings: Implements a security model with privilege levels (rings 0-3) to protect the system from malicious or buggy software.
- SIMD Extensions: Various extensions like MMX, SSE, AVX that allow a single instruction to perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously.
- Virtualization Support: Hardware features to efficiently run virtual machines.
