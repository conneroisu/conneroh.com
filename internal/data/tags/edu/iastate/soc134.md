# SOC 134: Introduction to Sociology

As an Electrical Engineering student, stepping into Sociology 134 was initially a venture outside my usual technical domain, but it quickly became an unexpectedly insightful and perspective-altering experience. The course, through its lectures, engaging discussions, and thought-provoking assignments, provided a robust framework for understanding the intricate ways society shapes our lives and how we, in turn, navigate and influence it.

The lectures laid a strong foundation. Concepts like the **sociological imagination** were pivotal, teaching me to connect personal troubles to broader public issues. Understanding the **social construction of reality**—how things like time, money, gender, and even emotions are given meaning through collective agreement—was eye-opening. For instance, exploring how "work-life balance" is a modern construct or how beauty standards evolve highlighted this. The lectures on **deviance and social control** provided a lens to see how norms are established and maintained, a theme I explored in discussions like my post on the "call of the void" and the societal checks that prevent such impulses. Learning about the **life course** and the concept of **emerging adulthood** was particularly relatable, explaining shifts in societal expectations for young adults. Even topics like **emotion management**, distinguishing between surface and deep acting, provided a new vocabulary for everyday experiences.

The discussion forums were a dynamic space to apply these concepts and engage with diverse viewpoints. I particularly valued exploring:
*   **Deviance and Social Control:** My reflection on the "call of the void" allowed me to dissect how internal, informal, and formal controls operate. Responding to Ella Duval's post on jaywalking further solidified my understanding of these mechanisms, especially in how campus norms interact with societal rules.
*   **Emotions:** Analyzing "Midwestern niceness" as a feeling rule helped me understand surface and deep acting, and the potential for emotive dissonance. The discussions around this, including Griffin Gade's points on pride, were enriching.
*   **McDonaldization:** Applying Ritzer's principles to Elon Musk's transformation of Twitter demonstrated how efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control manifest in modern tech platforms, a concept I also connected to globalization.
*   **Social Constructions:** In discussions on "People Types," I analyzed "slow fashion advocates" or "thifters" as a contemporary social construction, examining how this identity is learned and shapes consumer behavior. My exploration of "work-life balance" as a social construct also delved into its origins and impact.
*   **Privilege and Gender:** My posts on male privilege, rooted in physical differences and societal expectations, and my reflections on gender as a fluid extension of personality rather than rigid roles, sparked important personal and peer considerations.
*   **Performing Together:** The analysis of chapel as a staged performance, using Goffman's dramaturgical concepts like front stage, back stage, and aligning actions, was a fascinating way to deconstruct social interactions. Claire Breuer's response connecting it to choir and marching band added further depth.
*   **Romantic Scripts and Social Control & Inequality:** Exploring contemporary romantic scripts, like the nuances of the "hookup culture," and analyzing issues like the varied treatment of sex work through a social control lens, pushed me to think critically about evolving norms and power dynamics.

The assignments were instrumental in deepening this understanding:
*   The **Corey Ciocchetti lecture report on stress** provided practical insights into differentiating stressors and the importance of mindfulness, which I found immediately applicable.
*   The **movie analysis project** on *BlackKkKlansman* and *It Follows* was a highlight. Applying Goffman's dramaturgical theory to analyze impression management, front/back stage behaviors, and self-fulfilling prophecies in these films made the concepts incredibly tangible. My proposal to integrate this with a photo essay on self-fulfilling prophecies underscored my interest in synthesizing these ideas.
*   The **paper on male privilege**, stemming from Peggy McIntosh's work, was a significant exercise in self-reflection and understanding unearned advantages.
*   My **scholarly article project**, for which I proposed the research question, "How do gun-control laws influence societal dynamics related to crime rates, social trust, and individual well-being...?" and reviewed three academic articles, honed my ability to engage with sociological research critically.
*   Even the **Sociological Imagination assignment**, where I chose to focus on COVID's impact on hiring practices and education delivery (connecting to my work with Myelin Foundry), directly applied the course's core theme to real-world, contemporary events.

Overall, Sociology 134 has equipped me with a new lens. As an Electrical Engineering student, I might not have anticipated the relevance of sociology, but I now see its utility in understanding user behavior with technology, the societal impact of innovations, team dynamics in professional settings, and the ethical considerations that underpin engineering. It has fostered a greater awareness of the social forces at play in my own life and in the world around me, encouraging a more critical, empathetic, and nuanced understanding of social life. This course has undoubtedly broadened my intellectual horizons and will continue to inform my perspectives long after its conclusion.

In conclusion, Sociology 134 has been much more than an elective; it has provided a set of analytical tools and a deeper appreciation for the complex, often invisible, structures that govern social life. While my primary field remains Electrical Engineering, the insights gained from this class—about human behavior, social structures, inequality, and the power of social construction—will undoubtedly inform my perspective as both a professional and a citizen. It has encouraged me to think more critically, empathetically, and sociologically about the world we inhabit.
