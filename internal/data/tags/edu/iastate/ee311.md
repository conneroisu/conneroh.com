The journey of learning is a continuous process that shapes our understanding and perception of the world around us. This essay presents a comprehensive reflection on my learning experience in the course "Electromagnetic Fields and Waves" (`EE311`) at **Iowa State University**. The course, which is a critical component of my Electrical Engineering curriculum, has significantly contributed to my academic growth and understanding of the subject matter. The following reflection will include an analysis of my learning process, the challenges I encountered, the strategies I adopted to overcome these challenges, and the lessons I learned throughout the course. This reflection will not only highlight my academic growth but also shed light on the importance of adaptability, critical thinking, and the effective use of technology in enhancing the learning experience.

## What did I Learn

I feel that I learned a **great deal** this semester as always, but, this year especially, I feel that I battled every possible problem that a student could come across while maintaining my studies, work, and side-projects.

I also relearned the importance of sight and the responsibility of myself needing to ensure that my visual impairment is treated to the best of my ability. I realized after the first or second exam that I should have switched to contacts earlier in the semester.

Additionally, I learned that at some level, no amount of organization can justify the cost of a loss of either time or focus during a potential learning opportunity for learning. This further exposed to me the importance of balance and prioritization in achieving goals. It's crucial to understand that while organization is necessary, it should not compromise the time and focus required for learning. This understanding leads to a more efficient approach towards achieving personal and professional growth. This also emphasizes the need for flexibility in planning and scheduling in my life. It's important to allow room for adjustments and changes, as sticking too rigidly to a plan can limit opportunities for spontaneous learning, exploration of new ideas, or dedicated learning. Moreover, this insight highlights the value of being present in every moment. Rather than being preoccupied with planning or organizing, one should be fully engaged with the task at hand.

Also learned to scratch out work before writing the final product just like in programming where encounter this same problem of having to tackle each issue as they arise and have to follow the process before being able to clean, optimize, and extend. This focus on the presentation of my written work was challenging as I have mostly moved to digital/keyboard writing for my notes and mathematics. Though since most **Iowa State University** classes require some level of penmanship (actual physical writing), I think that they should not! Allowing for more effective learning and applications of technologies is what I believe to be at the core of Iowa State, and I find it disheartening that they do not adopt new formats of learning almost **contradictory** to their vision statement:

> Iowa State University will lead the world in advancing the land-grant ideals of putting science, technology, and human creativity to work

## How did I Learn/Change

I feel that I learned a great deal this semester. More specifically, I feel that I not only changed a great deal, but I think that I also grew a lot as a person and as a student.

I also improved my critical thinking skills and became more confident in my abilities through my studies, assignments and side-projects this semester. **More recently**, I gained a deeper understanding of the subjects that we covered in class, which has sparked my interest even more. The knowledge that I acquired this semester has not only helped me academically, but also in everyday life situations where penmanship is needed; that said though, I still remain steadfast in my beliefs that more avenues available to students of problem solving other than purely writing, specifically typing, should exist, but more on this later in **How could I have learned better**.

## How could I have Learned Better

I feel that I could have learned better through a collection of vises that I will now describe:

1. Real-world Applications: Seeing how the things I'm learning apply to real-world situations would have made them more relevant and interesting. I thought that the various engineering scenarios that we encountered in the games were beneficial to this fact, but wished that there could have been more games like this.

2. Technology-Enhanced Learning: Regarding the organization of the class in-terms of the online material, assignments, games, lectures, and announcements; unfortunately, not alone in thinking this, I think that the messy and chaotic online structure led many a student in the class to waste significant portions of time, including me. More surprising was the fact that we were ridiculed for not staying on top of the **giant** mess that accumulated over the course of the semester on canvas. Initially, I thought that it was a joke, but it soon became evident that we were expected to comb through the excetrions of information that would be silently uploaded over the course of the semester with obscere titles, names, and bodies to the texts.

3. Multi-sensory Learning: Reading about this topic recently, I think that incorporating multiple senses in the learning process would have made it more immersive and memorable. This could be through tactile materials, audio lessons, or even taste and smell-based activities for certain subjects.

4. Insomnia: Insomnia is a sleep disorder that is characterized by difficulty falling and/or staying asleep. People with insomnia have one or more of the following symptoms: difficulty falling asleep, waking up often during the night and having trouble going back to sleep, waking up too early in the morning, and feeling tired upon waking. I have dealt with horrid insomnia since I was a child, but have only recently, since sophomore year of college as I was pushing myself to accomplish more, how negatively impacting insomnia is to my everyday life. I am medicated for this, but have yet to find a solution that works permanently.

## What I Would Do Differently

Looking back, there are several things I would do differently. Firstly, I would have switched to contacts earlier in the semester to better manage my visual impairment. This would have allowed me to focus more on the course material and less on the physical challenges of seeing the board or reading text.

Secondly, I would have been more flexible in my approach to learning. While organization is important, I found that it can sometimes hinder the learning process if it becomes too rigid. I would have allowed more room for spontaneous learning and exploration of new ideas.

Thirdly, I would have advocated more for the use of technology in the classroom. I believe that digital tools can greatly enhance learning and make it more efficient. I would have pushed for more use of typing and digital note-taking, as I believe these methods are more effective for me.

Lastly, I would have sought help earlier for my insomnia. I now realize how much it affected my ability to focus and learn. In the future, I will prioritize my health and well-being to ensure I am in the best possible state to learn and grow.

## What I Hope to Achieve in the Future

Moving forward, I hope to continue improving my learning strategies and adapting them to suit my needs. I want to further develop my critical thinking skills and continue to grow both personally and professionally.

I also hope to see more use of technology in the classroom. I believe that digital tools can greatly enhance learning and make it more efficient. I will advocate for this change and hope to see it implemented in future courses.

Finally, I hope to manage my insomnia better so that it does not hinder my learning. I will seek help and explore different treatment options to find a solution that works for me.

In conclusion, this semester has been a period of significant growth and learning for me. I have learned a lot about myself and my learning style, and I am excited to apply these insights in the future. Despite the challenges, I am grateful for the experiences and lessons I have gained from this course.

# Recommendations for Future Students

Based on my experience in the EE311 course, "Electromagnetic Fields and Waves," at Iowa State University, I have several recommendations for future students:

> First, be prepared to face challenges. This course is not easy, but it is incredibly rewarding. You will encounter problems that will test your understanding and push you to think critically. Don't be discouraged by these challenges. Instead, see them as opportunities to grow and learn.

> Second, prioritize your health. I struggled with insomnia during the semester, which significantly affected my ability to focus and learn. If you have any health issues, seek help early and make sure you are in the best possible state to learn and grow.

> Third, be flexible in your approach to learning. While organization is important, it should not compromise the time and focus required for learning. Allow room for adjustments and changes, as sticking too rigidly to a plan can limit opportunities for spontaneous learning and exploration of new ideas.

> Fourth, advocate for the resources you need. If you're struggling with the material, don't hesitate to seek out additional resources. This could mean scheduling office hours with your professor, finding a tutor, or utilizing online resources. Remember, it's okay to ask for help.

> Fifth, make sure to regularly review and practice the material. This course is heavy on concepts and equations, so consistent practice is key to understanding and application. Try to solve as many problems as you can and discuss them with classmates or professors if you're having trouble.

> Six, participate actively in class discussions. These are designed to enhance your understanding of the course content and provide practical applications of the theories being taught. They also offer opportunities for collaborative learning which can be very beneficial.

> Lastly, maintain a positive attitude towards learning. It's natural to feel overwhelmed or frustrated at times but try not to let these feelings deter you from your goals. Remember that every challenge is an opportunity for growth and every mistake a chance to learn.

> In conclusion, `EE311` can be a demanding course but with determination, flexibility, active participation and effective use of resources, it can also be a rewarding learning experience. Good luck!
