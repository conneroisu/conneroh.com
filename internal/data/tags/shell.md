A shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for accessing an operating system's services. Shells execute commands, manage processes, handle I/O redirection, and provide scripting capabilities.

Modern shells offer features like command history, tab completion, job control, and programmable completion. From the traditional Bourne shell to modern alternatives like Nushell and Fish, each shell brings its own philosophy and features to enhance productivity at the command line.
