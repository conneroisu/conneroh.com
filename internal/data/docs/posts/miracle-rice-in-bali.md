# Miracle Rice in Bali: Computational Investigations into the Origins of Efficiency  

<!-- ![[ISU-Extension.png|300]] -->

---

## Abstract
> Bali is an Indonesian island whose population has long depended on rice cultivation. Its geography—shaped by volcanoes, some still active—creates steep northern slopes and an “inclined alluvial plane” to the south[^UN1979]. Instead of centralized, state‑run irrigation, Bali relies on a network of water temples—religious establishments that regulate water flow and collectively manage irrigation.

## Introduction
To review “Miracle Rice in Bali,” we must first summarize Lansing’s 1983 study. Steve Lansing, an anthropologist at the University of Arizona, investigated Bali’s temple‑based irrigation system and its five key organizational levels: water temples, sabuks, irrigation associations, rice‑terrace groups, and individual farmers. After the failed “Massive Guidance” initiative of the Green Revolution, Lansing teamed up with Bali’s High Priest and systems ecologist Dr. James Kremer to model and understand the indigenous system’s efficiency[^Rogers2003].

## Resources Abstracts

### Article From _Diffusion of Innovations_
Everett M. Rogers’s _Diffusion of Innovations_ (pp. 51–52) summarizes Lansing’s findings on Bali’s water‑temple networks[^Rogers2003].

### Princeton Study by Lansing
J. Stephen Lansing’s _Perfect Order_ (Princeton, 2012) is the in‑depth fieldwork monograph on Bali’s self‑organizing water‑temple networks[^lansingbook].

### Lansing Documentary
_The Goddess & the Computer_ (2007), directed by Steve Lansing and André Singer, documents the interplay of religion and irrigation in Bali and introduces the hydrological and pest‑modeling simulation[^DVD].

---

## Massive Guidance
International developers, including the United Nations, invested heavily to boost Bali’s rice exports by building dams, altering cropping patterns, and distributing pest‑resistant varieties[^UN1979]. However, pests adapted quickly, yields fell, and Lansing concluded that outsiders had underestimated Bali’s cultural irrigation practices.

---

## Simulator Program
In collaboration with Dr. Kremer, Lansing helped craft a simulation combining hydrology, rice growth, and pest dynamics. They measured soil chemistry, rainfall, runoff, water demand (upstream/downstream), pest damage, yield, growth stages, and more. The data revealed oxygen‑rich native rice fields that support local biodiversity. Although the High Priest controlled timing, Lansing advocated for democratizing the simulator’s access to optimize water‑temple management[^lansingbook][^DVD].

---

## Critiques of Lansing
Stefan Helmreich (MIT), in “Power/Networks: A Rejoinder to Lansing,” argues that Lansing’s work inadvertently reinforces hierarchical power structures by channeling control to traditional elites, a common concern in development contexts.

---

## Proposal
Given the simulator’s “gamifiable” fitness metrics, I propose integrating a deep neural network (DNN) to optimize irrigation variables. The DNN would improve “trialability” for lower‑status farmers by delivering accessible recommendations, thereby addressing Helmreich’s critique and broadening participation.

---

## Conclusion
This case study is rich but sprawling. Focusing more narrowly on either cultural dynamics or technological integration may strengthen future work. Attempts to locate the original Macintosh/Simulink program were unsuccessful, but the vision of infusing AI into Bali’s ancient system remains compelling.
