## Course Overview and Objectives

**AGEDS 461** is designed to provide students (primarily upper-level undergraduates in Agriculture and Life Sciences) with an in-depth understanding of how new ideas and technologies spread in agricultural contexts. The course emphasizes both the theoretical frameworks of innovation diffusion and the practical role of agricultural extension education in facilitating technology transfer. Key learning objectives include:

- Understanding **Diffusion of Innovations Theory** (e.g. Everett Rogers’ model) and related theories of adoption and change.
- Identifying the characteristics of innovations (such as relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, observability) that affect adoption rates ([Agricultural Education and Studies (AGEDS) | Iowa State University Catalog](https://catalog.iastate.edu/previouscatalogs/2024-2025/azcourses/ageds/#:~:text=Prereq%3A%20Junior%20classification%20Examine%20the,%28Typically%20Offered%3A%20Fall)).
- Recognizing the roles of **social systems, communication channels, and change agents** (extension educators, advisors, etc.) in the diffusion process.
- Analyzing case studies of how agricultural innovations have been introduced and adopted in different communities and countries, highlighting factors that led to success or failure.
- Applying situational analysis and needs assessment techniques to design strategies for implementing innovations in real-world agricultural or community settings (with an emphasis on international agricultural development contexts) ([Agricultural Education and Studies (AGEDS) | Iowa State University Catalog](https://catalog.iastate.edu/previouscatalogs/2019-2020/azcourses/ageds/#:~:text=Impact%20of%20agricultural%20and%20extension,in%20international%20agricultural%20education%20programs)) ([Agricultural Education and Studies (AGEDS) | Iowa State University Catalog](https://catalog.iastate.edu/previouscatalogs/2021-2022/azcourses/ageds/#:~:text=Impact%20of%20agricultural%20and%20extension,Meets%20International%20Perspectives%20Requirement)).
- Appreciating global perspectives by examining diffusion in international settings, thereby fulfilling the International Perspectives requirement.

By the end of the course, students should be able to critically evaluate why some agricultural innovations spread quickly while others do not, and formulate effective extension education approaches to promote the adoption of new technologies or practices.

## Weekly Topics and Schedule

The course syllabus is structured to progressively cover both theory and application. Below is a representative **weekly topic outline** based on a recent offering (Fall 2024), detailing the main focus for each week of the semester:

1. **Week 1 – Introduction to Innovation Diffusion:** Overview of the course and expectations. Introduction to basic concepts of innovation, diffusion, and the role of extension education. Discussion of why diffusion of agricultural innovations matters in both local and global contexts.
2. **Week 2 – Diffusion of Innovations Theory:** Study of the classic Diffusion of Innovations model (Everett Rogers), including the **innovation-decision process** (knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, confirmation). Key terminology and historical development of diffusion research are covered.
3. **Week 3 – Innovation Attributes and Adoption Rate:** Examination of the characteristics of innovations that influence adoption (e.g. relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, observability) ([Agricultural Education and Studies (AGEDS) | Iowa State University Catalog](https://catalog.iastate.edu/previouscatalogs/2024-2025/azcourses/ageds/#:~:text=Prereq%3A%20Junior%20classification%20Examine%20the,%28Typically%20Offered%3A%20Fall)). Students discuss how these factors have affected adoption of specific ag technologies. Short case examples are introduced to illustrate high vs. low adoption scenarios.
4. **Week 4 – Adopter Categories and Social Systems:** Analysis of the adopter categories (innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, laggards) and the **innovation adoption curve**. Exploration of social system dynamics, peer networks, and opinion leadership in communities. Students might classify adopters in a given case study and consider marketing/extension strategies for each group.
5. **Week 5 – Communication Channels in Diffusion:** Focus on how information spreads, comparing mass media vs. interpersonal channels in reaching potential adopters. Role-play or discussions on how an extension educator or change agent uses different communication strategies to disseminate new ideas.
6. **Week 6 – The Role of Change Agents and Extension Educators:** Understanding the role of extension services and change agents in facilitating innovation diffusion. Topics include how extension professionals build credibility, work with early adopters, and address barriers. Real-world examples from agricultural extension programs are examined.
7. **Week 7 – Case Studies in Agricultural Innovation (Domestic):** In-depth case study analysis of a successful (or failed) innovation diffusion in U.S. agriculture or community development. For example, the adoption of a precision agriculture tool or a conservation practice in Iowa. Students discuss factors that influenced the outcome, applying theory to practice.
8. **Week 8 – Mid-Semester Assessment and Review:** **Midterm exam** or quiz covering theory and concepts from Weeks 1–7. A review session reinforces key points like diffusion theory elements and case study insights. (Assignments: Midterm exam; project proposal due.)
9. **Week 9 – Diffusion in International Contexts:** Introduction to how diffusion processes play out in developing countries or international agricultural development projects ([Agricultural Education and Studies (AGEDS) | Iowa State University Catalog](https://catalog.iastate.edu/previouscatalogs/2019-2020/azcourses/ageds/#:~:text=Impact%20of%20agricultural%20and%20extension,in%20international%20agricultural%20education%20programs)). Discussion of cultural, economic, and infrastructure factors that can differ from U.S. contexts. Begin examining an international case (e.g. diffusion of drought-tolerant crop varieties in sub-Saharan Africa).
10. **Week 10 – Program Planning and Situational Analysis:** Students learn methods of **situational analysis** and needs assessment in extension settings ([Agricultural Education and Studies (AGEDS) | Iowa State University Catalog](https://catalog.iastate.edu/previouscatalogs/2019-2020/azcourses/ageds/#:~:text=Impact%20of%20agricultural%20and%20extension,in%20international%20agricultural%20education%20programs)). The class covers how to assess a community’s readiness and barriers for a new technology. Students may practice developing a simple extension program plan based on an identified need, using logic models or similar tools.
11. **Week 11 – Alternative Models and Theories of Change:** Exploration of other models related to innovation diffusion or technology transfer. This could include the Technology Transfer model, social marketing approaches, or theories like the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and how they compare to classical diffusion theory. Students consider how these frameworks might better explain certain adoption scenarios.
12. **Week 12 – Overcoming Barriers and Ethical Considerations:** Identification of common **barriers to adoption** (economic constraints, literacy/education, social resistance, policy issues). Discussion on ethical considerations in promoting innovations (e.g., respecting local knowledge, avoiding bias, ensuring equity in who benefits). Students brainstorm strategies extension educators can use to address these challenges.
13. **Week 13 – Student Presentations on Diffusion Case Studies:** Students present on individual or group case studies they have been researching. Each presentation analyzes a specific innovation’s diffusion (could be an international development project or a new ag technology) and relates it to course concepts. Peers and instructor provide feedback.
14. **Week 14 – Designing an Extension Intervention:** A capstone discussion on putting it all together – students outline an extension education intervention to promote a new innovation, applying best practices learned. This may involve small group workshopping of final project plans, ensuring that theoretical and practical elements are integrated.
15. **Week 15 – Course Synthesis and Final Exam:** Wrap-up of major themes. Reflection on how diffusion theory informs the role of agricultural educators and extension agents in the real world. Any remaining student project reports are submitted. The **final exam** is administered (covering post-midterm material and cumulative concepts), or final project presentations are completed if a written exam is not given.

_Note:_ The above schedule is based on a recent syllabus and is meant to illustrate the progression of topics from foundational theory to practical application. Specific ordering and content may vary by instructor or semester, but the core themes (diffusion theory, innovation attributes, adopter dynamics, case studies, and program planning in extension) are consistently covered.

## Assignments and Major Projects

Students in AGEDS 461 are evaluated through a combination of assignments, exams, and a major project. Key assignments and projects typically include:

- **Reading Reflections & Discussions:** Regular readings are assigned (e.g. chapters from _Diffusion of Innovations_ by Everett Rogers or scholarly articles). Students may need to post written reflections or participate in class discussions analyzing the readings. These tasks ensure students grasp theoretical concepts and can relate them to current agricultural issues.
- **Case Study Analyses:** Throughout the semester, students examine **case studies** of innovation diffusion in agriculture. For instance, a case might detail how a new farming practice was introduced in a certain region. Students might write short analysis papers or answer guided questions connecting the case to diffusion principles (identifying factors that aided or hindered adoption, roles of change agents, etc.). This applied exercise helps in **“utilizing situational analysis techniques to analyze and solve problems in international agricultural education programs”** as noted in the catalog ([Agricultural Education and Studies (AGEDS) | Iowa State University Catalog](https://catalog.iastate.edu/previouscatalogs/2019-2020/azcourses/ageds/#:~:text=Impact%20of%20agricultural%20and%20extension,in%20international%20agricultural%20education%20programs)).
- **Midterm Exam:** Around the middle of the term, an exam (or quiz series) tests students on key concepts and terminology. This typically covers the diffusion theory framework, innovation attributes, adopter categories, and other foundational knowledge introduced in the first half of the course.
- **Innovation Diffusion Project:** A major component is a semester-long project where each student (or team) selects an agricultural innovation or educational program to analyze in depth. Students apply course concepts to **assess the diffusion of that innovation**. This project often includes:
  - **Proposal:** Early in the term, submitting a brief proposal of the chosen innovation or technology and context (e.g. “Adoption of mobile soil testing services in X country” or “Diffusion of precision irrigation among Iowa farmers”).
  - **Written Report:** A detailed report that describes the innovation, its target audience, and context; analyzes the situation using diffusion models (innovation attributes, social system, communication channels, etc.); identifies barriers and enabling factors; and proposes recommendations for extension strategies to improve adoption.
  - **Presentation:** Toward the end of the semester, presenting findings to the class. This allows sharing of diverse cases (some domestic, some international) and peer learning. The presentation is typically 10–15 minutes, highlighting the case background, analysis, and lessons learned.
- **Extension Program Plan (Major Project Alternative):** In some iterations of the course, the major project is framed as designing an **Extension Education Program** plan. In this scenario, students assume the role of an extension educator and develop a plan to introduce and spread a specific innovation in a community. They must conduct a needs assessment, define objectives, outline activities (workshops, demos, field days, media use), and explain how they would evaluate adoption over time. This project ties together practical planning skills with diffusion theory.
- **Class Participation and Activities:** Because the class often involves interactive discussions (especially on case studies and brainstorming solutions), instructors evaluate participation. Students might engage in group activities like role-playing an extension meeting or critiquing a failed diffusion attempt, which contributes to their understanding and grades.
- **Final Exam or Final Project Submission:** The course typically concludes with either a comprehensive final exam or the final deliverables of the project. The **final exam** (if given) covers the latter half of the course (including international diffusion issues, alternative models, etc.) and synthesizes overall knowledge. If a final exam is not given (some instructors might use the project in lieu of an exam), then the **final project report** and/or presentation serves as the capstone assessment.

Throughout these assignments, emphasis is placed on applying theory to **real-world agricultural scenarios**. For example, students not only learn the abstract theory of innovation diffusion but also practice analyzing how extension strategies can be tailored to different audiences. The course’s blend of individual writing, exams, and group discussion ensures that students can both conceptually understand and practically implement strategies for effective technology transfer in agriculture. The official materials and syllabus from the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences highlight that by the end of AGEDS 461, students have engaged with both **scholarly perspectives and hands-on planning** for innovation diffusion in agricultural and extension education ([Agricultural Education and Studies (AGEDS) | Iowa State University Catalog](https://catalog.iastate.edu/previouscatalogs/2024-2025/azcourses/ageds/#:~:text=Prereq%3A%20Junior%20classification%20Examine%20the,%28Typically%20Offered%3A%20Fall)) ([Agricultural Education and Studies (AGEDS) | Iowa State University Catalog](https://catalog.iastate.edu/previouscatalogs/2019-2020/azcourses/ageds/#:~:text=Impact%20of%20agricultural%20and%20extension,in%20international%20agricultural%20education%20programs)).
