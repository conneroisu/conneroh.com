Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability with its indentation-based syntax and supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It features dynamic typing, automatic memory management, and an extensive standard library that facilitates development in areas such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and scientific computing. Python's ecosystem includes frameworks like Django and Flask for web development, TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning, and NumPy and Pandas for data analysis. Its cross-platform compatibility and ease of use make Python one of the most widely adopted programming languages in both industry and academia.
