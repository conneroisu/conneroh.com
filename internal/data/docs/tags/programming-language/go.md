Golang, also known as Go, is an open-source programming language designed by Google and first released in 2009.

Created by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson, Go is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong concurrency model, making it well-suited for cloud computing, microservices, and distributed systems.

It features a straightforward syntax, built-in concurrency support with goroutines and channels, high-performance native compilation, garbage collection, a robust standard library, static typing, and easy cross-compilation.
