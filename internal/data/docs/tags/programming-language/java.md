Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Known for its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy, Java applications run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making them platform-independent. It features automatic memory management via garbage collection, strong static typing, and an extensive standard library that supports networking, concurrency, and database interaction. Java is widely used for enterprise applications, web development (Spring framework), mobile development (Android), cloud computing, and large-scale distributed systems. Its ecosystem includes robust tools such as Maven and Gradle for build automation, JUnit for testing, and frameworks like Hibernate for database management. Java remains a dominant language in the software industry due to its scalability, security, and performance.
