# C#

C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft in the early 2000s as part of the .NET framework, designed to be simple, type-safe, and scalable.

It integrates elements from C++ and Java, providing automatic memory management via garbage collection and a strong type system to reduce common programming errors.

It supports features like asynchronous programming with async/await, LINQ for data manipulation, and advanced object-oriented principles, making it well-suited for large-scale software development.
