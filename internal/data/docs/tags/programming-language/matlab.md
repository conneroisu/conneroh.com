MATLAB (Matrix Laboratory) is a high-level programming language and computing environment developed by MathWorks, primarily used for numerical computing, data analysis, and algorithm development. First released in the 1980s, MATLAB is widely adopted in engineering, scientific research, and financial modeling due to its powerful built-in functions, extensive toolboxes, and ease of visualization. It supports matrix operations, signal processing, machine learning, and control systems design, making it a preferred choice for academia and industry. MATLAB's interactive environment allows for rapid prototyping and simulation, with integration capabilities for hardware and external programming languages such as C, C++, and Python. Its versatility and strong visualization tools make MATLAB an essential tool for researchers and engineers working with complex mathematical computations.
