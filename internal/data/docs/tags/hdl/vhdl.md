VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) is a hardware description language used to model and simulate digital circuits and systems. Developed in the 1980s by the U.S. Department of Defense as part of the VHSIC (Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit) program, VHDL enables designers to describe the behavior and structure of electronic systems at multiple levels of abstraction. It supports concurrent execution, making it well-suited for hardware design, verification, and synthesis into FPGA and ASIC implementations. VHDL is strongly typed and allows for modular, reusable components, making it a preferred choice in industries such as aerospace, telecommunications, and embedded systems. With robust simulation capabilities and compatibility with industry-standard electronic design automation (EDA) tools, VHDL remains a fundamental language in digital circuit design and verification.
