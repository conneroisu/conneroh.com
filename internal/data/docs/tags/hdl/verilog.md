Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used for modeling, designing, and verifying digital circuits and systems.

Originally developed in the 1980s by Gateway Design Automation, Verilog became an IEEE standard in 1995 (IEEE 1364) and is widely used for FPGA and ASIC development.

It features a C-like syntax and supports both behavioral and structural modeling, making it accessible for hardware designers and verification engineers.

Verilog enables concurrent execution and event-driven simulation, facilitating efficient testing and validation of digital designs.
