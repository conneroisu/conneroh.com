In the realm of modern development, managing environment secrets securely and efficiently is paramount. For Neovim users, seamlessly integrating these secrets into the editing environment can enhance productivity and security. Enter **doppler.nvim**, a plugin designed to bridge the gap between Doppler's secret management and Neovim's powerful editing capabilities.

## Understanding doppler.nvim

**doppler.nvim** is a Neovim plugin that injects Doppler secrets directly into your Neovim environment based on the Doppler configurations of your project. This integration ensures that environment-specific secrets are readily available within Neovim, streamlining workflows that depend on sensitive data.

## Key Features

- **Seamless Secret Injection:** Automatically injects Doppler-managed secrets into Neovim when editing within a Doppler-configured project.

- **On-Demand Loading:** Utilizes plugin managers like `lazy.nvim` to load the plugin as needed, optimizing Neovim's performance.

- **Dependency Management:** Relies on `nvim-lua/plenary.nvim` to ensure robust functionality.

## Installation Guide

To incorporate **doppler.nvim** into your Neovim setup using `lazy.nvim`, add the following configuration to your `init.lua`:


```lua
return {
    "conneroisu/doppler.nvim",
    dependencies = {
        'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim',
    },
}
```


This setup ensures that **doppler.nvim** loads only when required, maintaining an efficient editing environment.

## Why Choose doppler.nvim?

In scenarios where tests or development processes require environment-specific secrets, manually managing these variables can be cumbersome and error-prone. **doppler.nvim** automates this process by injecting the necessary secrets into Neovim upon detecting a Doppler-configured project. This automation not only enhances security by reducing manual handling of sensitive data but also streamlines the development workflow.

## Project Structure

The **doppler.nvim** project is organized as follows:


```
.
├── lua
│   ├── doppler
│   │   └── module.lua
│   └── doppler.lua
├── Makefile
├── plugin
│   └── doppler.lua
├── README.md
├── tests
│   ├── minimal_init.lua
│   └── doppler
│       └── doppler_spec.lua
```


This structure delineates the core functionality (`lua/doppler/`), plugin initialization (`plugin/doppler.lua`), and testing framework (`tests/`).

## Contribution and Community

Developed by Conner Ohnesorge, a senior in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Iowa State University, **doppler.nvim** reflects a commitment to enhancing the Neovim ecosystem. Contributions are welcome, with guidelines and a code of conduct available in the repository to foster a collaborative environment.

## Conclusion

**doppler.nvim** offers a seamless integration of Doppler's secret management into Neovim, enhancing both security and efficiency for developers. By automating the injection of environment secrets, it allows developers to focus on coding without the overhead of manual secret management. Explore the [doppler.nvim GitHub repository](https://github.com/conneroisu/doppler.nvim) to integrate this functionality into your Neovim setup.
