# conneroh.com

My personal website.


## Introduction

Previously, I had a website that was made in [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with a backend written in [Typescript](tags/programming-language/typescript.md). I was using Vecel for the hosting.

Now, I'm using [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the frontend With **Go** for the backend.
