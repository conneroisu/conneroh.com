# groq-go
As a college student passionate about developing tools that bridge the gap between Go applications and advanced language models, I created **groq-go**â€”an unofficial Go client library for the Groq API. This project enables seamless integration with various language models hosted on Groq's platform, facilitating efficient and type-safe interactions.

**Key Features of groq-go:**

- **Comprehensive Model Support:** groq-go supports all models available through the Groq API, ensuring type safety across interactions.

- **Streaming Capabilities:** The library allows for real-time data processing through streaming, enhancing responsiveness in applications.

- **Moderation Tools:** Integrated moderation features assist in maintaining content quality and safety within applications.

- **Audio Processing:** groq-go provides functionalities for audio transcription and translation, expanding the scope of multimedia applications.

- **Advanced Functionality Support:** The library includes support for tool usage and function calling, enabling complex operations and integrations.

- **JSON Schema Generation:** It offers JSON Schema generation from structs, streamlining data validation and documentation processes.

- **Extensible Integrations:** groq-go integrates with extensions such as Toolhouse, E2B, Composio, and Jigsaw Stack, providing a versatile foundation for diverse applications.

**Installation:**

To incorporate groq-go into your Go project, use the following command:


```bash
go get github.com/conneroisu/groq-go
```


**Examples and Use Cases:**

The repository includes an `examples` directory showcasing various applications of groq-go, such as:

- **Audio Processing:** Demonstrates audio transcription and translation capabilities.

- **JSON Handling:** Illustrates JSON Schema generation and manipulation.

- **Moderation:** Shows how to implement content moderation features.

- **Image Discussions:** Utilizes models like `llava-v1.5-7b-4096-preview` to generate image-related dialogues.

- **Terminal-Based Chat Applications:** Provides a foundation for building chat interfaces within the terminal.

- **VHDL File Documentation:** Automates the documentation process for VHDL files.

- **Python Code Execution via Toolhouse:** Demonstrates executing generated Python code using Toolhouse integration.

- **GitHub Repository Interactions using Composio:** Showcases interactions with GitHub repositories through Composio integration.

**Development and Contribution:**

groq-go is developed with a focus on performance and ease of use, aiming to facilitate efficient querying of open-source large language models through Groq's specially designed hardware. The project is open-source and licensed under the MIT License, encouraging community involvement and collaboration.
