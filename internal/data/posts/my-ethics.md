# My Ethics

This essay discusses the importance of having a personal code of ethics and using a thoughtful decision-making process to promote ethical behavior in organizations and professions. The essay discusses Conner Ohnesorge's code of ethics, which includes respecting autonomy, transparency, stakeholder impact, fairness, and justice, and being open-minded to feedback. The Conner Ohnesorge also emphasizes the importance of decision-making and reflecting on biases while seeking growth opportunities. It also highlights the Volkswagen emissions scandal as an example of unethical business practices. Respecting autonomy is a crucial ethical obligation that applies to many professional activities across different fields, including healthcare, social work, law, research ethics, and education. The essay emphasizes the need for transparency, considering stakeholder impact, promoting fairness and justice, being open-minded to feedback, reflecting on biases, and seeking growth opportunities to make more informed decisions that align with values and promote the common good.

The personal establishment of a code of ethics allows for easy sharing of ethical values and conduct. This document describes my code of ethics, including my approach to decision-making, my belief in respecting autonomy as a crucial ethical obligation, and my commitment to transparency, stakeholder impact, fairness and justice, being open-minded to feedback, reflecting on biases, and seeking growth opportunities. Having/following a "Code of Ethics" guides the members of a profession or an organization in their conduct and decision-making, especially when they face ethical dilemmas. A "Code of Ethics" usually reflects the values and principles of the profession or organization and sets standards for ethical behavior and responsibility.  The code is generally intended to guide members in handling challenging situations. Additionally, the code can help establish trust between the members and the public and create a sense of collective responsibility within the organization. As a result of these beliefs, this document has been written to explicitly state a personal code of ethics for Conner Ohnesorge.

When I am faced with an ethical situation, I use a combination of logic and empathy to make a decision. I consider the facts of the situation, the possible consequences of different actions, the relevant ethical principles and codes, and the perspectives and feelings of those affected by the situation.  I also strive to be mindful of the potential implications of my decision and its impact on stakeholders. Ultimately, I strive to make a decision that aligns with my values and beliefs while also considering the perspectives of others.

One major ethical obligation is to respect the autonomy of individuals. This means that professionals must acknowledge and uphold the right of individuals to make their own decisions about their lives, even if those decisions conflict with the professional's personal beliefs or values. This obligation applies to professional activities in various fields, such as healthcare, social work, and law. For example, healthcare professionals must obtain informed consent from patients before providing treatment or performing procedures. Social workers must respect the choices and preferences of their clients when developing support plans. Lawyers must advocate for their client's interests and uphold their legal rights, even if they disagree with the client's decisions.

A systematic argument can be made based on fundamental principles of ethics to support the application of respecting autonomy as an ethical obligation in professional action. One such principle is the principle of non-maleficence, which states that professionals should not harm others. Respecting autonomy is essential for avoiding harm because it allows individuals to make informed decisions about their lives and avoid unwanted interventions or violations of their rights. Furthermore, respecting autonomy is consistent with other ethical principles such as beneficence (doing good) and justice (fairness). By respecting individuals' autonomy, professionals can promote their well-being and ensure they are treated fairly.

Respecting autonomy is a crucial ethical obligation that applies to many professional activities across different fields. Upholding this obligation ensures that individuals are treated with dignity and respect while promoting their well-being and avoiding harm.
While this document describes my code of ethics, the following list provides specific examples of professional activities where the ethical obligation to respect autonomy applies include:

1. In healthcare, obtaining informed consent from patients before providing treatment or performing procedures.
2. In social work, respect clients' choices and preferences when developing support plans.
3. In law, advocating for clients' interests and upholding their legal rights, even if they disagree with the client's decisions.
4. In research ethics, obtaining informed consent from study participants before conducting research involving human subjects.
5. In education, respect students' choices regarding their academic goals and pursuits.

I believe it is important to be transparent and communicate my decision-making process to those involved. This helps build trust and accountability, even if others may not agree with my decision.

In addition, I feel that it is crucial to consider the impact of my decision on all stakeholders involved. I need to weigh the potential consequences of my actions and ensure that they align with my values and ethical principles. It is also essential to evaluate whether my decision is fair and just and whether it promotes the common good.

I additionally believe that it is important to be open-minded and receptive to feedback from others. If someone raises concerns or objections about my decision, I should be willing to listen and consider their perspective. This can help me identify potential blind spots or biases in my thinking and make more informed decisions.

During my group, analysis of the VW Issue in EE394,  we came to a consensus  describing the VW Issue described shortly below: 

The Volkswagen emissions scandal was a major breach of public trust and environmental regulations by the German automotive company Volkswagen Group. In September 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revealed that Volkswagen had intentionally programmed turbocharged diesel engines to activate their emissions controls only during laboratory emissions testing. This allowed them to produce cars that met tests' standards but emitted nitrogen oxides (NOx) at up to 40 times the standard level in everyday operations. The deliberate software manipulation allowed VW to market vehicles with excessive and illegal NOx emissions as "clean diesel vehicles," deceive, "g many customers and regulators worldwide. The scandal created a wave of controversy and legal proceedings that are still ongoing as of 2021.

The Volkswagen emissions scandal is an example of unethical behavior that betrays customers' trust and environmental regulations. Volkswagen's misconduct deceived customers by selling them cars that did not meet environmental standards while knowingly exposing them to potentially harmful levels of air pollution. The company has faced numerous lawsuits from governments, shareholders, and consumers worldwide for its unethical business practices.

Ethically, Volkswagen's misconduct betrayed its customers and environmental regulations. Not only did they deceive their customers by selling them cars that did not meet environmental standards, but they also knowingly exposed them to potentially harmful levels of air pollution. Furthermore, this deception was sanctioned by the highest levels within the company, making it even more unacceptable. As a result, Volkswagen has faced numerous lawsuits worldwide from governments, shareholders and consumers for its unethical business practices. 

By prioritizing transparency, considering stakeholder impact, promoting fairness and justice, being open-minded to feedback, and reflecting on my process continually, I can make more ethical decisions that align with my values. Stakeholders can be anyone who has expressed interest or care for you, the company, or otherwise. When making ethical decisions, we should consider its impact on other stakeholders and whether it promotes fairness and justice. Additionally, we should also consider if our decision is transparent or not. For example, an employer should be open and honest with their employees about the company's goals and policies to ensure fairness and promote transparency. Furthermore, being open-minded to feedback can help us make better ethical decisions. By listening to the opinions of others, we can gain insight into different perspectives. Considering stakeholder impact is also essential when making ethical decisions. By considering my decisions' impact on others, I can ensure that my choices benefit all parties involved. This helps to ensure fairness and justice by considering how my decisions may affect those around me and how they could potentially shape the organization's future. Promoting fairness and justice is also key in ethical decision-making processes. Considering all stakeholders’ perspectives when making decisions helps ensure that everyone’s opinions are taken into account and that no one party has an unfair advantage over another. Additionally, promoting fairness and justice helps create trust between all parties involved in the decision-making process. Transparency is one of the most important elements of an ethical decision-making process. By being transparent, I make sure everyone is aware of my decisions and why. This helps to avoid any potential conflicts or misunderstandings that may arise from my decision. Additionally, transparency helps to ensure that stakeholders are informed and can provide their input on any decisions I make. Being open-minded to feedback is also important when making ethical decisions. Listening to all stakeholders' feedback allows me to gain insight into their thoughts on a particular decision and how they feel it could benefit or hurt them personally or professionally. This helps me make more informed decisions by considering the perspectives of those involved in the decision-making process. Considering stakeholder impact is also important when making ethical decisions. Stakeholders can be anyone who has expressed interest or concern in decision-making. Taking their needs into consideration helps to ensure that all voices are heard and taken into account when making decisions. This helps promote fairness and justice, ensuring that everyone involved is treated fairly and equitably.

Finally, reflecting on my process continually helps me stay mindful of my actions throughout the decision-making process. By reflecting on my choices regularly, I can identify areas where improvement might be needed or where I can make more ethical choices in the future. Additionally, this reflection allows me to continually grow as a decision-maker and develop better skills for making ethical decisions. Parenting is a key component of ethical decision-making. It involves ensuring that all stakeholders know the decisions being made and how they will be affected. This ensures that everyone has a chance to provide input, have their concerns addressed, and trust the decisions being made. It also allows for greater accountability, allowing all stakeholders to reflect on the decision-making process and hold those responsible if any issues arise. Reflection on the process can help ensure ethical decision-making by allowing self-reflection on how well I adhere to my values and ethics. Ask me questions like “Is this decision fair?” or “Do I have enough information to make this decision?” I can better assess whether or not my decisions align with my values before taking action. 

Being open-minded to feedback is also essential for making ethical decisions. Listening to different points of view can help inform better decision-making and ensure that all stakeholders feel heard and respected throughout the process. It also helps to build trust between stakeholders, which can go a long way in fostering cooperation and commitment from those involved in the decision-making process. 

In addition, I must be aware of any power dynamics that may exist in a particular situation. This means considering how my position or privilege might affect another person's ability to voice their opinion or receive fair treatment. By being mindful of any power dynamics, I can strive to create an equal playing field where everyone's voice is heard and respected. For example, if I am in a meeting with people from different backgrounds, I must be aware of my privilege and be mindful of how this might affect the conversations. By being aware of any power dynamics, I can strive to create a safe and respectful environment where everyone feels comfortable and respected.  In a professional setting, it is also important to consider the ethical implications of any decisions made. This means being aware of potential conflicts of interest and how these may affect the outcome of a decision. For example, suppose I am in a leadership role and making decisions about how to allocate resources. In that case, I must be mindful of how those decisions might benefit or harm different stakeholders. It is important to consider all perspectives and try to make ethical and beneficial decisions for all stakeholders. 

Finally, I must remain open-minded and non-judgmental regarding different opinions or lifestyles. Respect for diversity should always be at the forefront of ethical decision-making; by being willing to listen and learn from others, I can ensure that my decisions are truly fair and just. Additionally, I need to be self-reflective and constantly evaluate my biases and prejudices, as these can influence my decisions in an unethical way. By being aware of my potential biases, I can ensure that my decisions are ethical and well-reasoned.

In conclusion, having a Code of Ethics and utilizing a thoughtful decision-making process are essential in promoting ethical behavior and responsibility within organizations and professions. By considering the impact on all stakeholders, being open-minded to feedback, reflecting on our biases, and constantly seeking opportunities for growth and improvement, we can make more informed decisions that align with our values and promote the common good. Ultimately, this fosters trust between members and the public and creates a sense of collective responsibility within organizations to act ethically and responsibly.
