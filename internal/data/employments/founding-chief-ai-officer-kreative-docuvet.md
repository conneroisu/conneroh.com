  - Developed real-time speech-to-text systems with speaker diarization
  - Built custom LLM pipelines for generating structured veterinary notes
  - Integrated AI services with existing veterinary practice management systems
  - Implemented HIPAA-compliant data processing workflows

- **Developed tools for exploring large language model responses**
  - Created interactive interfaces for analyzing LLM outputs
  - Built evaluation frameworks for model performance
  - Developed prompt engineering tools for optimizing model behavior
  - Implemented A/B testing systems for different AI configurations

- **Collected a large veterinarian voice corpus and built training scripts**
  - Designed and implemented data collection protocols
  - Built automated data processing pipelines for audio preprocessing
  - Created training scripts for fine-tuning speech recognition models
  - Developed quality assurance tools for dataset validation

## Technical Skills Acquired

- **Artificial Intelligence**: LLM integration, prompt engineering, model evaluation
- **LLM Pipelines**: Building production-ready AI workflows
- **Data Pipeline Development**: Scalable data processing architectures
