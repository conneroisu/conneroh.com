# Machine Learning Researcher at Iowa State University

**Position**: Machine Learning Researcher  
**Company**: Iowa State University  
**Location**: Ames, IA  
**Employment Period**: December 2021 - April 2022  
**Industry**: Research / Machine Learning

## Overview

As a Machine Learning Researcher at Iowa State University, I conducted independent research focused on developing brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. This senior research project involved creating a system that could recognize hand gestures from EEG (electroencephalogram) signals in real-time, pushing the boundaries of human-computer interaction.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Developed an EEG gesture recognition program as part of a senior research project**
  - Designed experimental protocols for EEG data collection
  - Built data acquisition pipelines for brain signal processing
  - Implemented signal preprocessing techniques (filtering, artifact removal)
  - Created feature extraction algorithms for EEG signals
  - Developed machine learning models for gesture classification

- **Conducted extensive data analysis and model training**
  - Collected and annotated EEG datasets from multiple subjects
  - Performed statistical analysis on brain signal patterns
  - Experimented with various ML algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Deep Learning)
  - Optimized model hyperparameters for improved accuracy
  - Validated models using cross-validation and real-world testing

- **Implemented real-time gesture recognition**
  - Built low-latency signal processing pipelines
  - Optimized algorithms for real-time performance
  - Created visualization tools for monitoring brain activity
  - Developed user interfaces for BCI interaction
  - Implemented feedback mechanisms for user training

## Technical Skills Acquired

- **Machine Learning**: Classification algorithms, deep learning, model optimization
- **Data Analysis**: Signal processing, statistical analysis, feature engineering
- **Real-time Systems**: Low-latency processing, streaming data handling
- **Python**: Scientific computing with NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **EEG Signal Processing**: Filtering, artifact removal, feature extraction
- **Research Methods**: Experimental design, data collection, scientific writing

## Research Outcomes

- Achieved 85% accuracy in recognizing 5 different hand gestures from EEG signals
- Reduced gesture recognition latency to under 500ms for real-time applications
- Presented findings at the Iowa State University Undergraduate Research Symposium
- Contributed to advancing BCI technology for assistive applications

## Impact

This research demonstrated the feasibility of using consumer-grade EEG devices for gesture recognition, opening possibilities for affordable brain-computer interfaces. The system I developed showed potential applications in assistive technology for individuals with motor disabilities, gaming interfaces, and hands-free device control. The project laid groundwork for future research in non-invasive brain-computer interaction at Iowa State University.
