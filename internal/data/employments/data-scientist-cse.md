# Data Scientist at CSE

**Position**: Data Scientist  
**Company**: CSE  
**Location**: Colorado Springs, CO  
**Employment Period**: June 2024 - August 2024  
**Industry**: Data Science / Technology

## Overview

As a Data Scientist at CSE, I was responsible for developing and maintaining data infrastructure focused on college sports analytics. This role required building scalable, resource-efficient solutions that could handle large volumes of data while working within computational constraints.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Developed resource constrained data pipelines** and large-scale scrapers of college sports data using Golang
  - Built efficient data collection systems that could process millions of records
  - Implemented rate limiting and retry mechanisms to ensure reliable data acquisition
  - Optimized memory usage for processing large datasets on limited hardware

- **Optimized and managed MySQL databases**
  - Designed and implemented database schemas for efficient data storage
  - Created indexes and optimized queries for faster data retrieval
  - Implemented database backup and recovery procedures

- **Fixed and improved Python scripts under time pressure**
  - Debugged and refactored legacy data processing scripts
  - Improved script performance and reliability
  - Added error handling and logging for better monitoring

## Technical Skills Acquired

- **Golang**: Advanced proficiency in building concurrent, efficient applications
- **MySQL**: Database design, optimization, and administration
- **Python**: Data processing, scripting, and debugging
- **SQL**: Complex query writing and optimization
- **Data Pipeline Development**: Building scalable ETL processes
- **Web Scraping**: Developing robust scrapers with proper error handling

## Impact

Successfully built and deployed data pipelines that collected and processed sports data for analytics purposes. The systems I developed continued to run reliably after my internship ended, providing valuable data for the company's analytics products.
