To accomplish this, a Test Pattern Generator IP is instantiated and configured using the AXI bus to produce a video stream that is provided to the VDMA. The VDMA is configured to store this stream to a memory location and forward the stream to an AXI Stream output IP block, which passes the stream to the AVNET HDMI Output IP block. This gives the test pattern stream a direct path to the FMC module so it can be displayed.</p>\n<p>However, we also need to incorporate timing information. Similar to the VGA protocol, HDMI requires timing signals to make sure line draws are all synced up. To do this a Video Timing Controller IP block is used. This IP block is configured off of an AXI bus fed to it and it outputs all the timing signals that the HDMI IP block needs. These timing signals are fed into the AXI Stream to Video Out IP block, which then forwards the timing signals to the AVNET HDMI Output.</p>\n<p>In addition, there are two I2C IP blocks, the FMC IPMI ID EEPROM I2C block and the FMC IMAGEON I2C block. The purpose of the IMAGEON interface is to provide a way for the ZYNQ processor to control the FMC peripheral. Then, the purpose of the EEPROM I2C interface is to provide the ZYNQ processor a way to configure the on-board EEPROM on the FMC, which stores important information.</p>\n<p>For the VDMA, the primary difference between this setup and the setup from MP-0 is that the VDMA is configured for both reads and writes. There is a stream incoming from the TPG that is written to memory, and then that memory is read out to the HDMI. This requires GenLock synchronization between the reads and writes, which was not needed in MP-0.</p>\n<p>Finally, there are two clock domains defined for this design, a 100MHz clock and a 148Mhz clock. The 100MHz clock is used for all the AXI bus transactions and is considered the primary clock. Then the 148MHz clock is used for the video clock. Looking at the block diagram, all modules that are fed a video stream use this clock and this clock is passed directly to the AVENT HDMI IP block. So, it is safe to say that the purpose of the 148MHz clock is to clock the video streams.</p>\n<p>This design only allows for the display of the test pattern, so we need to add more IP cores later to use the camera.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-changes-we-made-to-camera-appc\"><a class=\"anchor permalink p-4\" href=\"#what-are-the-changes-we-made-to-camera-appc\">#</a> What are the changes we made to <code>camera_app.c</code>?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"tpg-change\"><a class=\"anchor permalink p-4\" href=\"#tpg-change\">#</a> TPG Change</h3>\n<p>For the TPG change, we referenced the provided datasheet to see what we configure via memory mapped registers. We saw that we had the ability to set a foreground and background to be a variety of preset patters. So, we set the background to a colored bars pattern (register value <code>0x9</code>) and the foreground to be a colored box that bounces around (register value <code>0x1</code>). Since we were enabling a box, we had to specify its dimensions and colors, which was simple to due since there were registers for each. The relevant code for this update is shown below:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;\"><code><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>   <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// Define convenient volatile pointers for accessing TPG registers\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"></span>   <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">volatile</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">uint32_t</span> <span style=\"color:#f92672\">*</span>TPG_CR       <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> (<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">volatile</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">uint32_t</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">*</span>) (config<span style=\"color:#f92672\">-&gt;</span>uBaseAddr_TPG_PatternGenerator <span style=\"color:#f92672\">+</span> <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">0</span>);

This is confirmed by the IOSTANDARD setting for these signals:</p>\n<pre><code>set_property IOSTANDARD LVDS_25 [get_ports IO_VITA_CAM_clk_out_*]\nset_property IOSTANDARD LVDS_25 [get_ports IO_VITA_CAM_sync_*]\nset_property IOSTANDARD LVDS_25 [get_ports IO_VITA_CAM_data_*]\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"what-lvds-is-and-how-does-it-work\"><a class=\"anchor permalink p-4\" href=\"#what-lvds-is-and-how-does-it-work\">#</a> What LVDS Is and How Does It Work?</h3>\n<p>LVDS uses a pair of complementary signals that are transmitted on two separate traces:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>_p</code> suffix indicates the positive/true signal</li>\n<li>The <code>_n</code> suffix indicates the negative/complement signal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The actual data is determined by the voltage difference between these two signals rather than the absolute voltage level.

LVDS supports high-speed data rates (often above 1 Gbps per pair) as seen in the 2.692 ns clock period (approximately 371 MHz).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Noise Immunity</strong>: Since LVDS relies on the difference between two signals rather than absolute voltage, it's highly resistant to common-mode noise that would affect both lines equally.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Low EMI</strong>: The differential pairs carry equal and opposite currents, causing the electromagnetic fields to cancel out, which reduces electromagnetic interference.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Signal Integrity</strong>: The constraint file also sets differential termination for these signals:</p>\n<pre><code>set_property DIFF_TERM true [get_ports IO_VITA_CAM_clk_out_*]\nset_property DIFF_TERM true [get_ports IO_VITA_CAM_sync_*]\nset_property DIFF_TERM true [get_ports IO_VITA_CAM_data_*]\n</code></pre>\n<p>This ensures proper signal integrity by eliminating reflections.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this design, LVDS is specifically used for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clock signals (<code>IO_VITA_CAM_clk_out_p/n</code>) - to provide a stable, clean timing reference</li>\n<li>Synchronization signals (<code>IO_VITA_CAM_sync_p/n</code>) - for frame timing synchronization</li>\n<li>Data lines (<code>IO_VITA_CAM_data_p/n</code>) - carrying the actual pixel data from the sensor</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"why-are-we-appending-10000000-to-the-output-of-the-vita-2000-camera-also-why-would-it-not-make-sense-to-append-00000000\"><a class=\"anchor permalink p-4\" href=\"#why-are-we-appending-10000000-to-the-output-of-the-vita-2000-camera-also-why-would-it-not-make-sense-to-append-00000000\">#</a> Why are we appending 10000000 to the output of the VITA-2000 camera? Also, why would it not make sense to append 00000000?</h2>\n<p>The 0x10000000 offset creates a safe &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; for the video frame buffers that won't interfere with other memory usage in the system. This is particularly important for video processing which involves large, continuous memory accesses through DMA that could otherwise corrupt system memory.</p>\n<p>It would not make sense to append 0x00000000 to the output of the VITA-2000 camera because it would almost certainly result in memory corruption as the video data would overwrite critical program memory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-at-this-point-does-the-camera-had-no-color\"><a class=\"anchor permalink p-4\" href=\"#why-at-this-point-does-the-camera-had-no-color\">#</a> Why at this point, does the camera had no color?</h2>\n<p>Before implementing the demosaicing algorithm and software processing, the camera had no color because the raw data from the camera sensor is in a Bayer pattern format rather than a processed RGB or YCbCr color format.</p>\n<p><strong>Bayer Pattern Sensor Format</strong>:</p>\n<p>The VITA-2000 camera sensor uses a Bayer filter pattern. This means each pixel captures only one color component (Red, Green, or Blue) arranged in a specific pattern.</p>\n<p><strong>Direct Raw Data Display</strong>: Without the demosaic and color processing enabled, the system is directly displaying the raw Bayer pattern data, which appears as a grayscale or monochrome image. Each pixel only contains intensity information for a single color, but the display treats it as luminance-only data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"software-demosaicing-implementation\"><a class=\"anchor permalink p-4\" href=\"#software-demosaicing-implementation\">#</a> Software Demosaicing Implementation</h2>\n<p>To implement our software demosaicing C code, we simply ran it in the main <code>camera_loop</code> function, making sure to provide pointers to the data coming in and where the demosaiced data should go to.

operation to the incoming data and the rest of the code shown here is to manage the frame buffers. To allow for an easier time measuring the performance metrics and to remove tearing, we used the frame buffers smartly.</p>\n<p>Since the demosaicing software takes a while to run, we take a single snapshot image, store it in frame buffer 0, and then let the VDMA write the incoming stream to frame buffer 1. Then, the deomosaicing software can run on frame buffer 0.</p>\n<p>For displaying the image, we decided to treat two different read frame buffers as front and back buffers. The demosaicing code updates the back buffer while the read channel of the VDMA streams the front buffer contents to the HDMI interface. Then once the demosaicing software has ran, the buffers are swapped, which displays the latest processed frame. This worked quite well and removed many artifacts in our images.

One of the video processing modules converts the RGB output from the demosaicing module to YUV 444 then the other video processing module converts the YUV 444 data to YUV 422, which is what the FMC IMAGEON module expects. The output from the YUV 444 to YUV 422 is then passed through an AXI Stream Converter and is then passed to the VDMA like before. So in summary, three pipeline stages were added:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Demosaicing</li>\n<li>RGB to YUV 444 Conversion</li>\n<li>YUV 444 to YUV 422 Conversion</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"performance\"><a class=\"anchor permalink p-4\" href=\"#performance\">#</a> Performance</h2>\n<h3 id=\"introduction-how-we-measured-performance\"><a class=\"anchor permalink p-4\" href=\"#introduction-how-we-measured-performance\">#</a> Introduction (how we measured performance)</h3>\n<p>We measured the performance of the software and hardware pipelines in this design utilizing interrupt-driven time measurements. Using interrupts allows the software to be aware when a frame is read or written by the VDMA. Then by using timers, we can get extremely accurate frame write times, which can be used to derive the resulting average frames per second (FPS).</p>\n<h3 id=\"software-pipeline\"><a class=\"anchor permalink p-4\" href=\"#software-pipeline\">#</a> Software Pipeline</h3>\n<h4 id=\"performance-1\"><a class=\"anchor permalink p-4\" href=\"#performance-1\">#</a> Performance</h4>\n<p>For subgroup B, we determined that the average frame rate is <code>0.396 FPS</code></p>\n<p>This is quite slow, which is due to the software demosaicing algorithm not being optimized well and the fact that over 2 million half-word writes are required to process a single image!</p>\n<h4 id=\"testing-methodology\"><a class=\"anchor permalink p-4\" href=\"#testing-methodology\">#</a> Testing Methodology</h4>\n<p>As previously stated, we used interrupts and timers to measure the FPS. We setup interrupts for the VDMA read channel frame completion and the write channel frame completion. This allowed us to know when frames were written to the VDMA and read from the VDMA. However, we had to find a solution to isolate the frame that is being processed since we don't shut down the VDMA.</p>\n<p>To do this, we stored a single frame in frame buffer 0, which the demosaicing software ran on. Then, once the demosaicing was finished, we updated the VDMA read channel to read this new frame out. By using the park pointer VDMA registers, we were able to detect when this new frame was written out and start/stop timers accordingly on this event. By comparing the current write time to the previous write time, we can determine how long it took to write out the last frame, which gives us our FPS value! Finally, we averaged 10 FPS values together to produce a final FPS value!</p>\n<p>The interrupt service routines and park pointer register modification code is shown below:</p>\n<p>Globals</p>\n<pre

that the average frame rate is <code>59.794 FPS</code></p>\n<p>This is what we expect since the timing was setup for 60Hz writes, which is 60 times a second.</p>\n<h4 id=\"testing-methodology-1\"><a class=\"anchor permalink p-4\" href=\"#testing-methodology-1\">#</a> Testing Methodology</h4>\n<p>The testing methodology used for the hardware pipeline is quite similar to what we used for the software pipeline. We made use of VDMA read and write interrupts and the processing system timers to record the time passed between frame writes. However, since we don't have to wait on C code to run, we did not need to single out a frame and keep track of it. We could simply let the VDMA run with a few conditions to make sure we are recording the times fine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A VDMA write must happen before a VDMA read can occur. We need to take into consideration the VDMA write time.</li>\n<li>Only record times between VDMA reads to two different frame buffers. If multiple reads are done on the same frame buffer, we know that the write channel is lagging behind, so we should wait until the frame buffer counter increments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The interrupt service routines that implement this are shown below:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;\"><code><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span

According to the embedded drivers for the IP, the VPSS has a zoom and scale core that can be used to perform a digital zoom by relaying display information in a user-specified window that can then be scaled to a desired dimension. To do this, I opted to add a separate core in addition to the two used in the original hardware pipeline for colour space conversion and chroma sampling, as I worried the additional operations could cause timing issues during the video processing. The final pipeline was as follows: Demosiac -&gt; Zoom and Scale VPSS -&gt; CSC VPSS -&gt; 444:422 VPSS -&gt; VDMA. Unfortunately, the driver documentation leaves something to be desired and there lacks an accessible example for this design. This resulted in an awfully heuristic design process, which ultimately produced a rather lackluster product. However, a product nonetheless. Although it still suffers from artifacts, a digital zoom of at most 85% of the original resolution was achieved before the video became distorted and corrupted. An example of the corrupted image can be seen below:</p>\n<p>assets/zoom_issue.png<img src=\"/dist/img/projects/cpre488-mp2/zoom_issue.png\" alt=\"assets/zoom_issue.png\" /></p>\n<p>As the zoom increased past the 85% threshold, only a small segment of the top of the display would repeat. This segment seemed like it would duplicate and shrink as the zoom factor increased. Originally, I had believed that the issue lied in the output resolution of the zoom core being incompatible with the HDMI. For example, when I played around with the picture in picture mode, a similar artifact manifested - as seen below:</p>\n<p>assets/pip_fun.png<img src=\"/dist/img/projects/cpre488-mp2/pip_fun.png\" alt=\"assets/pip_fun.png\" /></p>\n<p>For that reason, I figured that using the horizontal and vertical scaler cores could help align the output video resolution. However, I was unsure as to how to properly sequence the core configurations as there was a lack of relative documentation. Looking at the AMD forums, it seemed that many people experiencing similar artifacts blamed unaligned VDMA writes or bandwidth bottlenecks. In an attempt to address the VDMA issues, I tried to dynamically reconfigure the VDMA such that it could scale the non-1080p output of the zoom core to 1080p for the HDMI. I also tried allowing for unaligned VDMA reads and writes. Neither of these worked. I also wanted to try increasing the sample rate of the hardware pipeline to 2 or more pixels per clock, but I ran out of time before I could test this hypothesis.</p>\n<p>In the end, I was able to perform a digital zoom in some way, as seen (barely) in the following image:</p>\n<p>assets/embaressing.png<img src=\"/dist/img/projects/cpre488-mp2/embaressing.png\" alt=\"assets/embaressing.png\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"sobel-edge-detector\"><a class=\"anchor permalink p-4\" href=\"#sobel-edge-detector\">#</a> Sobel Edge Detector</h3>\n<p>The Sobel edge detector was implemented through software - in a similar manner to the Bayer reconstruction software.

To accomplish this, a Test Pattern Generator IP is instantiated and configured using the AXI bus to produce a video stream that is provided to the VDMA. The VDMA is configured to store this stream to a memory location and forward the stream to an AXI Stream output IP block, which passes the stream to the AVNET HDMI Output IP block. This gives the test pattern stream a direct path to the FMC module so it can be displayed.\n\nHowever, we also need to incorporate timing information. Similar to the VGA protocol, HDMI requires timing signals to make sure line draws are all synced up. To do this a Video Timing Controller IP block is used. This IP block is configured off of an AXI bus fed to it and it outputs all the timing signals that the HDMI IP block needs. These timing signals are fed into the AXI Stream to Video Out IP block, which then forwards the timing signals to the AVNET HDMI Output.\n\nIn addition, there are two I2C IP blocks, the FMC IPMI ID EEPROM I2C block and the FMC IMAGEON I2C block. The purpose of the IMAGEON interface is to provide a way for the ZYNQ processor to control the FMC peripheral. Then, the purpose of the EEPROM I2C interface is to provide the ZYNQ processor a way to configure the on-board EEPROM on the FMC, which stores important information.\n\nFor the VDMA, the primary difference between this setup and the setup from MP-0 is that the VDMA is configured for both reads and writes. There is a stream incoming from the TPG that is written to memory, and then that memory is read out to the HDMI. This requires GenLock synchronization between the reads and writes, which was not needed in MP-0.\n\nFinally, there are two clock domains defined for this design, a 100MHz clock and a 148Mhz clock. The 100MHz clock is used for all the AXI bus transactions and is considered the primary clock. Then the 148MHz clock is used for the video clock. Looking at the block diagram, all modules that are fed a video stream use this clock and this clock is passed directly to the AVENT HDMI IP block. So, it is safe to say that the purpose of the 148MHz clock is to clock the video streams.\n\nThis design only allows for the display of the test pattern, so we need to add more IP cores later to use the camera.\n\n\n## What are the changes we made to `camera_app.c`?\n\n### TPG Change\nFor the TPG change, we referenced the provided datasheet to see what we configure via memory mapped registers. We saw that we had the ability to set a foreground and background to be a variety of preset patters. So, we set the background to a colored bars pattern (register value `0x9`) and the foreground to be a colored box that bounces around (register value `0x1`). Since we were enabling a box, we had to specify its dimensions and colors, which was simple to due since there were registers for each. The relevant code for this update is shown below:\n\n```c\n   // Define convenient volatile pointers for accessing TPG registers\n   volatile uint32_t *TPG_CR       = (volatile uint32_t*) (config->uBaseAddr_TPG_PatternGenerator + 0);    // TPG Control\n   volatile uint32_t *TPG_Act_H    = (volatile uint32_t*) (config->uBaseAddr_TPG_PatternGenerator + 0x10); // Active Height\n   volatile uint32_t *TPG_Act_W    = (volatile uint32_t*) (config->uBaseAddr_TPG_PatternGenerator + 0x18); // Active Width\n   volatile uint32_t *TPG_BGP      = (volatile uint32_t*) (config->uBaseAddr_TPG_PatternGenerator + 0x20); // Background Pattern\n   volatile uint32_t *TPG_FGP      = (volatile uint32_t*) (config->uBaseAddr_TPG_PatternGenerator + 0x28); // Foreground Pattern\n   volatile uint32_t *TPG_MS       = (volatile uint32_t*) (config->uBaseAddr_TPG_PatternGenerator + 0x38); // Motion Speed\n   volatile uint32_t *TPG_CF       = (volatile uint32_t*) (config->uBaseAddr_TPG_PatternGenerator + 0x40); // TPG Color Format\n   volatile uint32_t *TPG_BOX_SIZE = (volatile uint32_t*) (config->uBaseAddr_TPG_PatternGenerator + 0x78);\n   volatile uint32_t *TPG_BOX_COLOR_Y = (volatile uint32_t*) (config->uBaseAddr_TPG_PatternGenerator + 0x80);\n   volatile uint32_t *TPG_BOX_COLOR_U = (volatile uint32_t*) (config->uBaseAddr_TPG_PatternGenerator + 0x88);\n   volatile uint32_t *TPG_BOX_COLOR_V = (volatile uint32_t*) (config->uBaseAddr_TPG_PatternGenerator + 0x90);\n\n   xil_printf(\"Test Pattern Generator Initialization ...\\n\\r\");\n\n   // Direct Memory Mapped access of TPG configuration registers\n   // See TPG data sheet for configuring the TPG for other features\n   TPG_Act_H[0]  = 0x438; // Active Height\n   TPG_Act_W[0]  = 0x780; // Active Width\n   TPG_BGP[0]    = 0x09;  // Background Pattern\n   TPG_FGP[0]    = 0x01;  // Foreground Pattern\n   TPG_MS[0]     = 0x04;  // Motion Speed\n   TPG_BOX_SIZE[0] = 100;\n   TPG_BOX_COLOR_Y[0] = 167;\n   TPG_BOX_COLOR_U[0] = 120;\n   TPG_BOX_COLOR_V[0] = 8;\n   TPG_CF[0]     = 0x02;  // TPG Color Format\n   TPG_CR[0]     = 0x81;  // TPG Control\n```\n\n\nA picture of the output of this change is shown below:\n\n![TPG Change](dist/img/projects/cpre488-mp2/tpg_change.png)\n\n### Software Only Change (TPG Registers not Modified)\nFor the software only change, we decided to read out the pixel colors in the YUV format and halve the luminance.  We believed that knowing the YUV format early on in the lab would be beneficial later when we have to implement SW demosaicing. The code that reads the YUV data, halves the luminance, and then writes it back is shown below:\n\n```c\nfor (i = 0; i < 1920*1080; i += 2)\n\t\t{\n\t\t   uint8_t u, v = 0;\n\t\t   uint16_t y = 0;\n\n\t\t   u = (pS2MM_Mem[i] & 0xFF00) >> 8;\n\t\t   v = (pS2MM_Mem[i + 1] & 0xFF00) >> 8;\n\t\t   y = (pS2MM_Mem[i] & 0xFF) | ((pS2MM_Mem[i + 1] & 0xFF) << 8);\n\n\t\t   // Half luminance\n\t\t   y /= 2;\n\n\t\t   // Set from YUV values.\n\t       pMM2S_Mem[i] = (u << 8) | (y & 0xFF);\n\t       pMM2S_Mem[i + 1] = (v << 8) | ((y & 0xFF00) >> 8);\n\t\t}\n```\n\nThe YUV 422 format is described later in this report.\n\nA picture of the output from this change is shown below:\n\n![TPG Change SW](/dist/img/projects/cpre488-mp2/tpg_change_sw.png)\n\nThough it is quite hard to see in this image, the luminance has be halved. My phone camera dod not pick this up well.\n## In the (`.xdc`) constraints file, what does the `_p` and `_n` pairing of signals signify, and what this configuration is typically used for?\n\nIn the constraints file, the `_p` and `_n` suffix pairs indicate differential signaling, specifically LVDS (Low-Voltage Differential Signaling). This is confirmed by the IOSTANDARD setting for these signals:\n\n```\nset_property IOSTANDARD LVDS_25 [get_ports IO_VITA_CAM_clk_out_*]\nset_property IOSTANDARD LVDS_25 [get_ports IO_VITA_CAM_sync_*]\nset_property IOSTANDARD LVDS_25 [get_ports IO_VITA_CAM_data_*]\n```\n\n### What LVDS Is and How Does It Work?\n\nLVDS uses a pair of complementary signals that are transmitted on two separate traces:\n- The `_p` suffix indicates the positive/true signal\n- The `_n` suffix indicates the negative/complement signal\n\nThe actual data is determined by the voltage difference between these two signals rather than the absolute voltage level. Typically, a small voltage difference (around 350mV) is used, where:\n- A positive difference represents a logical '1'\n- A negative difference represents a logical '0'\n\n### Why Is LVDS Used for the Camera Interface?\n\nLVDS is used for the VITA camera interface for several important reasons:\n\n1. **High-Speed Data Transfer**: The VITA-2000 sensor needs to transfer large amounts of image data quickly. LVDS supports high-speed data rates (often above 1 Gbps per pair) as seen in the 2.692 ns clock period (approximately 371 MHz).\n\n2. **Noise Immunity**: Since LVDS relies on the difference between two signals rather than absolute voltage, it's highly resistant to common-mode noise that would affect both lines equally.\n\n3. **Low EMI**: The differential pairs carry equal and opposite currents, causing the electromagnetic fields to cancel out, which reduces electromagnetic interference.\n\n4. **Signal Integrity**: The constraint file also sets differential termination for these signals:\n   ```\n   set_property DIFF_TERM true [get_ports IO_VITA_CAM_clk_out_*]\n   set_property DIFF_TERM true [get_ports IO_VITA_CAM_sync_*]\n   set_property DIFF_TERM true [get_ports IO_VITA_CAM_data_*]\n   ```\n   This ensures proper signal integrity by eliminating reflections.\n\nIn this design, LVDS is specifically used for:\n- Clock signals (`IO_VITA_CAM_clk_out_p/n`) - to provide a stable, clean timing reference\n- Synchronization signals (`IO_VITA_CAM_sync_p/n`) - for frame timing synchronization\n- Data lines (`IO_VITA_CAM_data_p/n`) - carrying the actual pixel data from the sensor\n\n## Why are we appending 10000000 to the output of the VITA-2000 camera? Also, why would it not make sense to append 00000000?\n\nThe 0x10000000 offset creates a safe \"sandbox\" for the video frame buffers that won't interfere with other memory usage in the system. This is particularly important for video processing which involves large, continuous memory accesses through DMA that could otherwise corrupt system memory.\n\nIt would not make sense to append 0x00000000 to the output of the VITA-2000 camera because it would almost certainly result in memory corruption as the video data would overwrite critical program memory.\n  \n## Why at this point, does the camera had no color?\n\nBefore implementing the demosaicing algorithm and software processing, the camera had no color because the raw data from the camera sensor is in a Bayer pattern format rather than a processed RGB or YCbCr color format.\n\n**Bayer Pattern Sensor Format**:\n\nThe VITA-2000 camera sensor uses a Bayer filter pattern. This means each pixel captures only one color component (Red, Green, or Blue) arranged in a specific pattern.\n    \n**Direct Raw Data Display**: Without the demosaic and color processing enabled, the system is directly displaying the raw Bayer pattern data, which appears as a grayscale or monochrome image. Each pixel only contains intensity information for a single color, but the display treats it as luminance-only data.\n\n\n## Software Demosaicing Implementation\n\nTo implement our software demosaicing C code, we simply ran it in the main `camera_loop` function, making sure to provide pointers to the data coming in and where the demosaiced data should go to. Subgroup B's code for this is shown below:\n\n```c\n\t\tset_park_frame(&(config->vdma_hdmi), 0, XAXIVDMA_WRITE);\n\n\t\t// Wait until frame zero is being written to.\n\t\twhile(get_current_frame_pointer(&(config->vdma_hdmi), XAXIVDMA_WRITE))\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tset_park_frame(&(config->vdma_hdmi), 1, XAXIVDMA_WRITE);\n\n\t\t// Wait until frame one is being written to.\n\t\twhile(!get_current_frame_pointer(&(config->vdma_hdmi), XAXIVDMA_WRITE))\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// Apply CFA\n\t\trun_demosaicing((uint16_t*)pS2MM_Mem, (uint16_t*)pMM2S_Mem);\n\n\t\t// Swap back and front buffers\n\t\tu8 temp = back_buffer_frame;\n\n\t\tback_buffer_frame = front_buffer_frame;\n\t\tfront_buffer_frame = temp;\n\n\t\t// Have the read side park on the new front buffer\n\t\tset_park_frame(&(config->vdma_hdmi), front_buffer_frame, XAXIVDMA_READ);\n\n\t\t// Wait for park frame to update.\n\t\twhile(get_current_frame_pointer(&(config->vdma_hdmi), XAXIVDMA_READ) != front_buffer_frame)\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// Update pMM2S_Mem to point to back buffer.\n\t\tpMM2S_Mem = (Xuint16 *)XAxiVdma_ReadReg(config->vdma_hdmi.BaseAddr, XAXIVDMA_MM2S_ADDR_OFFSET+XAXIVDMA_START_ADDR_OFFSET + (back_buffer_frame * 0x4));\n```\n\nThe function `run_demosaicing` applies the demosaic operation to the incoming data and the rest of the code shown here is to manage the frame buffers. To allow for an easier time measuring the performance metrics and to remove tearing, we used the frame buffers smartly.\n\nSince the demosaicing software takes a while to run, we take a single snapshot image, store it in frame buffer 0, and then let the VDMA write the incoming stream to frame buffer 1. Then, the deomosaicing software can run on frame buffer 0.\n\nFor displaying the image, we decided to treat two different read frame buffers as front and back buffers. The demosaicing code updates the back buffer while the read channel of the VDMA streams the front buffer contents to the HDMI interface. Then once the demosaicing software has ran, the buffers are swapped, which displays the latest processed frame. This worked quite well and removed many artifacts in our images. An example of an image that resulted from the software demosaicing is shown below (image quality is a bit poor due to my phone):\n\n![SW Demo](/dist/img/projects/cpre488-mp2/sw_demo.png)\n   \n## YCbCr 4:2:2 Format Analysis\n\n### Note from the Documentation\n4:4:4 to 4:2:2 Conversion Eq from Subsystem Documentation (PG231):\n\n$$\no_{x,y} = \\left[\\sum_{k=0}^{N_{\\text{taps}}-1} i_{x-k,y}\\, \\text{COEF}_{k,\\text{HPHASEO}}\\right]_0^{2^{D_w}-1}\n$$\n\n\nEquation 3-11\n\nThis conversion is a horizontal 2:1 decimation operation, implemented using a low-pass FIR filter to suppress chroma aliasing. In order to evaluate output pixel $o_x$,$o_y$, the FIR filter in the core convolves COEFk_HPHASE0, where k is the coefficient index, $i_x$,$i_y$ are pixels from the input image, and $[ ]^M_m$ represents rounding with clipping at M, and clamping at m. DW is the Data Width or number of bits per video component. Ntaps is the number of filter taps. The predefined filter coefficients are `[0.25 0.5 0.25]`. \n\n### Primary Analysis\nIn the YCbCr 4:2:2 format, each 32-bit word (0xF0525A52, 0x36912291, 0x6E29F029) contains data for two adjacent pixels. Breaking down these values:\n\n```c\n// Frame #1 - Red pixels\nfor (i = 0; i < storage_size / config->uNumFrames_HdmiFrameBuffer; i += 4) {\n  *pStorageMem++ = 0xF0525A52;  // Red\n}\n```\n\n1. **Red Example (0xF0525A52)**:\n   - This represents two pixels in sequence\n   - First 16 bits (0xF052): Y1=0xF0, Cb=0x52\n   - Second 16 bits (0x5A52): Y2=0x5A, Cr=0x52\n   \n```c\n// Frame #2 - Green pixels\nfor (i = 0; i < storage_size / config->uNumFrames_HdmiFrameBuffer; i += 4) {\n  *pStorageMem++ = 0x36912291; // Green\n}\n```\n2. **Green Example (0x36912291)**:\n   - First 16 bits (0x3691): Y1=0x36, Cb=0x91\n   - Second 16 bits (0x2291): Y2=0x22, Cr=0x91\n   \n```c\n// Frame #3 - Blue pixels\nfor (i = 0; i < storage_size / config->uNumFrames_HdmiFrameBuffer; i += 4) {\n  *pStorageMem++ = 0x6E29F029;  // Blue\n}\n```\n3. **Blue Example (0x6E29F029)**:\n   - First 16 bits (0x6E29): Y1=0x6E, Cb=0x29\n   - Second 16 bits (0xF029): Y2=0xF0, Cr=0x29\n\nThe pattern for each color follows the YCbCr 4:2:2 format where:\n- Each 16-bit word contains one Y (luminance) value and one chrominance (Cb or Cr) value\n- The chrominance values alternate between Cb and Cr\n- Two adjacent pixels share the same Cb and Cr values (the subsampling)\n\n## Format Structure\n\nThe 4:2:2 format packs data as follows for each pair of pixels:\n```\n[Y1][Cb][Y2][Cr]\n```\n\nWhere:\n- Y1: Luminance for first pixel\n- Cb: Blue color difference (shared between two pixels)\n- Y2: Luminance for second pixel\n- Cr: Red color difference (shared between two pixels)\n\nThis format maintains full luminance resolution (the \"4\" in 4:2:2) while halving the horizontal resolution of the color information (the \"2:2\"). This works well because human vision is more sensitive to changes in brightness than in color.\n\nFor the `camera_loop()` function's conversion pass, this format would need to be maintained when processing the data, ensuring that each 32-bit word continues to represent two pixels in the YCbCr 4:2:2 format, with the appropriate luminance and chrominance values preserved during the vertical flip operation.\n\n## Image Processing Pipeline\n\nBelow is the resulting block diagram after adding the pipeline (we did not have enough time to update our original diagram, we have provided a description of the changes below):\n\n![](/dist/img/projects/cpre488-mp2/HW-BD.png)\n\nThe pipeline consists of an IP block that does demosaicing to the incoming video stream and two video processing modules. One of the video processing modules converts the RGB output from the demosaicing module to YUV 444 then the other video processing module converts the YUV 444 data to YUV 422, which is what the FMC IMAGEON module expects. The output from the YUV 444 to YUV 422 is then passed through an AXI Stream Converter and is then passed to the VDMA like before. So in summary, three pipeline stages were added:\n\n1. Demosaicing\n2. RGB to YUV 444 Conversion\n3. YUV 444 to YUV 422 Conversion \n\n## Performance\n\n### Introduction (how we measured performance)\n\nWe measured the performance of the software and hardware pipelines in this design utilizing interrupt-driven time measurements. Using interrupts allows the software to be aware when a frame is read or written by the VDMA. Then by using timers, we can get extremely accurate frame write times, which can be used to derive the resulting average frames per second (FPS). \n\n### Software Pipeline \n\n#### Performance\nFor subgroup B, we determined that the average frame rate is `0.396 FPS`\n\nThis is quite slow, which is due to the software demosaicing algorithm not being optimized well and the fact that over 2 million half-word writes are required to process a single image!\n\n#### Testing Methodology\nAs previously stated, we used interrupts and timers to measure the FPS. We setup interrupts for the VDMA read channel frame completion and the write channel frame completion. This allowed us to know when frames were written to the VDMA and read from the VDMA. However, we had to find a solution to isolate the frame that is being processed since we don't shut down the VDMA. \n\nTo do this, we stored a single frame in frame buffer 0, which the demosaicing software ran on. Then, once the demosaicing was finished, we updated the VDMA read channel to read this new frame out. By using the park pointer VDMA registers, we were able to detect when this new frame was written out and start/stop timers accordingly on this event. By comparing the current write time to the previous write time, we can determine how long it took to write out the last frame, which gives us our FPS value! Finally, we averaged 10 FPS values together to produce a final FPS value!\n\nThe interrupt service routines and park pointer register modification code is shown below:\n\nGlobals\n```c\n// Timing globals\nstatic fps_t fps;\nstatic int sw_mode = 0;\nstatic int snapshot_saved = 0;\n\nstatic u8 back_buffer_frame = 2;\nstatic u8 front_buffer_frame = 3;\n\n// Frame that indicates that the write completed.\nstatic u8 target_frame = 2;\n\nstatic XTime tStart, tEnd = 0;\n\n// In seconds\nstatic float frame_time = 0;\n```\n\nISRS:\n```c\nvoid video_frame_output_isr(void* CallBackRef, u32 InterruptTypes)\n{\n\tswitch(InterruptTypes)\n\t{\n\t\tcase XAXIVDMA_IXR_FRMCNT_MASK:\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t// Once we have read from the back buffer, we know that it is the new front buffer\n\t\t\t// so we must have just swapped.\n\t\t\tif(sw_mode && (get_current_frame_pointer((XAxiVdma*) CallBackRef, XAXIVDMA_READ) == target_frame) && snapshot_saved)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t// We start and stop the timer on this ISR.\n\t\t\t\t// If this is the first frame, the timer won't be started, so start it up without ending any timer.\n\t\t\t\tif(!tStart)\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tXTime_GetTime(&tStart);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tXTime_GetTime(&tEnd);\n\t\t\t\t\tsnapshot_saved = 0;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tframe_time = (tEnd - tStart) / (float)COUNTS_PER_SECOND;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tfps_time_store(&fps, frame_time);\n\n\t\t\t\t\tsprintf(fps_msg, \"Average FPS: %.5f\", fps_calculate(&fps));\n\n\t\t\t\t\txil_printf(\"%s\\n\\r\", fps_msg);\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Start the timer back up!\n\t\t\t\t\tXTime_GetTime(&tStart);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tdefault:\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\nvoid camera_input_isr(void* CallBackRef, u32 InterruptTypes)\n{\n\tswitch(InterruptTypes)\n\t{\n\t\tcase XAXIVDMA_IXR_FRMCNT_MASK:\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tif(sw_mode && get_current_frame_pointer((XAxiVdma*)CallBackRef, XAXIVDMA_WRITE) == 0 && !snapshot_saved)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tsnapshot_saved = 1;\n\t\t\t\ttarget_frame = back_buffer_frame;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tdefault:\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nPark Pointer Register Modifications\n```c\n\t\tset_park_frame(&(config->vdma_hdmi), 0, XAXIVDMA_WRITE);\n\n\t\t// Wait until frame zero is being written to.\n\t\twhile(get_current_frame_pointer(&(config->vdma_hdmi), XAXIVDMA_WRITE))\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tset_park_frame(&(config->vdma_hdmi), 1, XAXIVDMA_WRITE);\n\n\t\t// Wait until frame one is being written to.\n\t\twhile(!get_current_frame_pointer(&(config->vdma_hdmi), XAXIVDMA_WRITE))\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// Apply CFA\n\t\trun_demosaicing((uint16_t*)pS2MM_Mem, (uint16_t*)pMM2S_Mem);\n\n\t\t// Swap back and front buffers\n\t\tu8 temp = back_buffer_frame;\n\n\t\tback_buffer_frame = front_buffer_frame;\n\t\tfront_buffer_frame = temp;\n\n\t\t// Have the read side park on the new front buffer\n\t\tset_park_frame(&(config->vdma_hdmi), front_buffer_frame, XAXIVDMA_READ);\n\n\t\t// Wait for park frame to update.\n\t\twhile(get_current_frame_pointer(&(config->vdma_hdmi), XAXIVDMA_READ) != front_buffer_frame)\n\t\t{\n\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// Update pMM2S_Mem to point to back buffer.\n\t\tpMM2S_Mem = (Xuint16 *)XAxiVdma_ReadReg(config->vdma_hdmi.BaseAddr, XAXIVDMA_MM2S_ADDR_OFFSET+XAXIVDMA_START_ADDR_OFFSET + (back_buffer_frame * 0x4));\n```\n### Hardware Pipeline \n\n#### Performance\nFor subgroup B, we determined that the average frame rate is `59.794 FPS`\n\nThis is what we expect since the timing was setup for 60Hz writes, which is 60 times a second.\n\n#### Testing Methodology\nThe testing methodology used for the hardware pipeline is quite similar to what we used for the software pipeline. We made use of VDMA read and write interrupts and the processing system timers to record the time passed between frame writes. However, since we don't have to wait on C code to run, we did not need to single out a frame and keep track of it. We could simply let the VDMA run with a few conditions to make sure we are recording the times fine:\n\n- A VDMA write must happen before a VDMA read can occur. We need to take into consideration the VDMA write time.\n- Only record times between VDMA reads to two different frame buffers. If multiple reads are done on the same frame buffer, we know that the write channel is lagging behind, so we should wait until the frame buffer counter increments.\n\nThe interrupt service routines that implement this are shown below:\n\n```c\nvoid video_frame_output_isr(void* CallBackRef, u32 InterruptTypes)\n{\n\tswitch(InterruptTypes)\n\t{\n\t\tcase XAXIVDMA_IXR_FRMCNT_MASK:\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tu8 current_frame = get_current_frame_pointer((XAxiVdma*) CallBackRef, XAXIVDMA_READ);\n\n\t\t\t// Make sure we received something before recording that we wrote it.\n\t\t\tif(rec_flag && (current_frame != prev_frame))\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t// If first frame, start only\n\t\t\t\tif(!tStart)\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tXTime_GetTime(&tStart);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tXTime_GetTime(&tEnd);\n\n\t\t\t\t\tfps_reading = (tEnd - tStart) / (float)COUNTS_PER_SECOND;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tfps_time_store(&fps, fps_reading);\n\n#if OUTPUT_FPS\n\t\t\t\t\tsprintf(fps_msg, \"Average FPS: %.5f\", fps_calculate(&fps));\n\n\t\t\t\t\txil_printf(\"%s\\n\\r\", fps_msg);\n#endif\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Start the timer back up!\n\t\t\t\t\tXTime_GetTime(&tStart);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\trec_flag = 0;\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\tprev_frame = current_frame;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tdefault:\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n}\n\n// Does nothing as of now. All timer operations are done when a frame is drawn to the screen.\nvoid camera_input_isr(void* CallBackRef, u32 InterruptTypes)\n{\n\tswitch(InterruptTypes)\n\t{\n\t\tcase XAXIVDMA_IXR_FRMCNT_MASK:\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tif(!rec_flag)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\trec_flag = 1;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t}\n\n\n\t\tdefault:\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n}\n```\n\nOverall, it was quite tedious to get interrupts working, but it definitely paid off!\n\n## Bonus Credit\n\nThe following sections describe the bonus credit tasks that were completed for this project and how they were implemented/accomplished.\n\n### Various analog and digital adjustments for the gain, exposure, and other common user-configurable digital camera settings. \n\nWe implemented the following adjustments:\n- Contrast\n- Brightness\n- Saturation\n\nThese were implemented by leveraging the second Subsystem which converts 4:4:4 to 4:2:2 and the `xvprocss.h` defined utilities.\n\n#### Gain\n\n### 1. Brightness Adjustment\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe brightness level is adjusted dynamically through a dedicated function. When invoked (for example, via board buttons), it calls the hardware API to update the brightness level of the processed video image.\n\n**Code Sample:**\n```c\nvoid set_brightness(\n    camera_config_t *config,\n    int percent // Brightness level as a percentage\n)\n{\n   if (config->bVerbose)\n   {\n      xil_printf(\"Setting brightness to %d\\n\\r\", percent);\n   }\n   // Apply the brightness adjustment using the video processing subsystem\n   XVprocSs_SetPictureBrightness(&proc_ss_RGB_YCrCb_444, (s32)percent);\n}\n```\n\n\n### 2. Contrast Adjustment\n\n**Explanation:**  \nSimilarly, contrast is adjusted using a dedicated function that calls the hardware API to modify the contrast level. This allows users to dynamically control the difference between light and dark areas in the image.\n\n**Code Sample:**\n```c\nvoid set_contrast(\n    camera_config_t *config,\n    int percent // Contrast level as a percentage\n)\n{\n   if (config->bVerbose)\n   {\n      xil_printf(\"Setting contrast to %d\\n\\r\", percent);\n   }\n   // Apply the contrast adjustment using the video processing subsystem\n   XVprocSs_SetPictureContrast(&proc_ss_RGB_YCrCb_444, (s32)percent);\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Saturation Adjustment\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe saturation adjustment function controls the vividness of the colors in the video output. This function calls the corresponding hardware API to adjust the saturation level in the YCrCb color space.\n\n**Code Sample:**\n```c\nvoid set_saturation(\n    camera_config_t *config,\n    int percent // Saturation level as a percentage\n)\n{\n   if (config->bVerbose)\n   {\n      xil_printf(\"Setting saturation to %d\\n\\r\", percent);\n   }\n   // Apply the saturation adjustment using the video processing subsystem\n   XVprocSs_SetPictureSaturation(&proc_ss_RGB_YCrCb_444, (s32)percent);\n}\n```\n\nUsing the buttons on the board (code resused from mp-1), the user can adjust the gain, contrast, brightness, and saturation. \n\n### A video mode, which records and can replay up to 5 seconds of 1080p video. \n\nVideo mode was about decreasing the delay from image to image in the play mode and increasing the number of images that can be stored in the software. This was done by removing the 2-second delay in image capture and increasing the heap size to correspond with the increased number of stored images.\n\n\n**Code Sample:**\n```c\n_HEAP_SIZE = DEFINED(_HEAP_SIZE) ? _HEAP_SIZE : 0x19000000;\n```\n\n### A digital zoom mode, which uses the up and down buttons to zoom in and out of the current scene.\n\nThe digital zoom was implemented partially through the crop and scale capabilities of the fully fledged Video Processing Subsystem (v2.2) IP core. According to the embedded drivers for the IP, the VPSS has a zoom and scale core that can be used to perform a digital zoom by relaying display information in a user-specified window that can then be scaled to a desired dimension. To do this, I opted to add a separate core in addition to the two used in the original hardware pipeline for colour space conversion and chroma sampling, as I worried the additional operations could cause timing issues during the video processing. The final pipeline was as follows: Demosiac -> Zoom and Scale VPSS -> CSC VPSS -> 444:422 VPSS -> VDMA. Unfortunately, the driver documentation leaves something to be desired and there lacks an accessible example for this design. This resulted in an awfully heuristic design process, which ultimately produced a rather lackluster product. However, a product nonetheless. Although it still suffers from artifacts, a digital zoom of at most 85% of the original resolution was achieved before the video became distorted and corrupted. An example of the corrupted image can be seen below:\n\n![assets/zoom_issue.png](/dist/img/projects/cpre488-mp2/zoom_issue.png)\n\nAs the zoom increased past the 85% threshold, only a small segment of the top of the display would repeat. This segment seemed like it would duplicate and shrink as the zoom factor increased. Originally, I had believed that the issue lied in the output resolution of the zoom core being incompatible with the HDMI. For example, when I played around with the picture in picture mode, a similar artifact manifested - as seen below:\n\n![assets/pip_fun.png](/dist/img/projects/cpre488-mp2/pip_fun.png)\n\nFor that reason, I figured that using the horizontal and vertical scaler cores could help align the output video resolution. However, I was unsure as to how to properly sequence the core configurations as there was a lack of relative documentation. Looking at the AMD forums, it seemed that many people experiencing similar artifacts blamed unaligned VDMA writes or bandwidth bottlenecks. In an attempt to address the VDMA issues, I tried to dynamically reconfigure the VDMA such that it could scale the non-1080p output of the zoom core to 1080p for the HDMI. I also tried allowing for unaligned VDMA reads and writes. Neither of these worked. I also wanted to try increasing the sample rate of the hardware pipeline to 2 or more pixels per clock, but I ran out of time before I could test this hypothesis. \n\nIn the end, I was able to perform a digital zoom in some way, as seen (barely) in the following image:\n\n![assets/embaressing.png](/dist/img/projects/cpre488-mp2/embaressing.png)\n\n### Sobel Edge Detector\n\nThe Sobel edge detector was implemented through software - in a similar manner to the Bayer reconstruction software. This meant the operation could be achieved with the following convolution algorithm:\n\n```c\n// Kernels\nuint32_t i, j, gx, gy = 0;\nuint32_t mx[3][3] = {\n\t{-1, 0, 1},\n\t{-2, 0, 2},\n  {-1, 0, 1}\n};\n  uint32_t my[3][3] = {\n\t{-1, -2, -1},\n\t{0, 0, 0},\n  {1, 2, 1}\n};\n\n// Convolution\nfor (int x = 0; x < 1000; x++) {\n  for (i = 1; i < 1080 - 2; i++) {\n    for (j = 1; j < 1920 - 2; j++) {\n      uint32_t r, t = 0;\n      uint32_t gx = 0, gy = 0;\n        for (r = 0; r < 3; r++) {\n          for (t = 0; t < 3; t++) {\n\t \t\t\t\t\tuint32_t image_index = (i + r - 1) * 1920 + (j + t - 1);\n\t \t\t\t\t\tuint32_t pixel_value = pS2MM_Mem[image_index];\n\t \t\t\t\t\tgx += pixel_value * mx[r][t];\n\t \t\t\t\t\tgy += pixel_value * my[r][t];\n\t \t\t\t\t}\n\t \t\t\t}\n\t      uint32_t output = sqrt(gx*gx + gy*gy);\n\t      pMM2S_Mem[i * COL_SIZE + j] = output;\n\t  }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe resulting effects can be seen below:\n\n![assets/Sobel_ex.png](/dist/img/projects/cpre488-mp2/Sobel_ex.png)\n\nIt should be noted that a better result could have been achieved should only luminance value be used, but I ran out of time before I could implement it.  \n\n",

For Neovim users, seamlessly integrating these secrets into the editing environment can enhance productivity and security. Enter **doppler.nvim**, a plugin designed to bridge the gap between Doppler's secret management and Neovim's powerful editing capabilities.\n\n## Understanding doppler.nvim\n\n**doppler.nvim** is a Neovim plugin that injects Doppler secrets directly into your Neovim environment based on the Doppler configurations of your project. This integration ensures that environment-specific secrets are readily available within Neovim, streamlining workflows that depend on sensitive data.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Seamless Secret Injection:** Automatically injects Doppler-managed secrets into Neovim when editing within a Doppler-configured project.\n\n- **On-Demand Loading:** Utilizes plugin managers like `lazy.nvim` to load the plugin as needed, optimizing Neovim's performance.\n\n- **Dependency Management:** Relies on `nvim-lua/plenary.nvim` to ensure robust functionality.\n\n## Installation Guide\n\nTo incorporate **doppler.nvim** into your Neovim setup using `lazy.nvim`, add the following configuration to your `init.lua`:\n\n\n```lua\nreturn {\n    \"conneroisu/doppler.nvim\",\n    dependencies = {\n        'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim',\n    },\n}\n```\n\n\nThis setup ensures that **doppler.nvim** loads only when required, maintaining an efficient editing environment.\n\n## Why Choose doppler.nvim?\n\nIn scenarios where tests or development processes require environment-specific secrets, manually managing these variables can be cumbersome and error-prone. **doppler.nvim** automates this process by injecting the necessary secrets into Neovim upon detecting a Doppler-configured project. This automation not only enhances security by reducing manual handling of sensitive data but also streamlines the development workflow.\n\n## Project Structure\n\nThe **doppler.nvim** project is organized as follows:\n\n\n```\n.\n├── lua\n│   ├── doppler\n│   │   └── module.lua\n│   └── doppler.lua\n├── Makefile\n├── plugin\n│   └── doppler.lua\n├── README.md\n├── tests\n│   ├── minimal_init.lua\n│   └── doppler\n│       └── doppler_spec.lua\n```\n\n\nThis structure delineates the core functionality (`lua/doppler/`), plugin initialization (`plugin/doppler.lua`), and testing framework (`tests/`).\n\n## Contribution and Community\n\nDeveloped by Conner Ohnesorge, a senior in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Iowa State University, **doppler.nvim** reflects a commitment to enhancing the Neovim ecosystem. Contributions are welcome, with guidelines and a code of conduct available in the repository to foster a collaborative environment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**doppler.nvim** offers a seamless integration of Doppler's secret management into Neovim, enhancing both security and efficiency for developers.

As a developer deeply immersed in the Zig programming language, I envisioned a solution that would seamlessly integrate Zig's compile-time capabilities with efficient database operations. This vision culminated in the creation of **libsqlz**, a compile-time ORM-ish library tailored for Zig developers who possess a comprehensive understanding of their database schemas.\n\n## The Inspiration Behind libsqlz\n\nThe motivation for developing libsqlz stemmed from the challenges I faced when working with databases in Zig. Existing solutions either lacked the performance I desired or failed to leverage the powerful compile-time features that Zig offers. I sought to create a library that would allow developers to define their database schemas at compile time, ensuring type safety and eliminating the need for runtime introspection. By doing so, I aimed to provide a tool that aligns with Zig's philosophy of simplicity and performance.\n\n## Introducing libsqlz\n\nlibsqlz is designed for developers who have a clear understanding of their database schema during the development phase. By utilizing Zig's compile-time execution, libsqlz enables the definition and manipulation of database schemas directly within Zig code. This approach eliminates the need for runtime schema parsing, thereby enhancing performance and ensuring type safety.\n\n## Key Features of libsqlz\n\n- **Compile-Time Schema Definition:** Define your database schema at compile time, ensuring type safety and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.\n\n- **Seamless Integration with Zig's Build System:** Integrate libsqlz effortlessly into your Zig projects by incorporating it into your `build.zig` file.\n\n- **Performance-Oriented Design:** By eliminating runtime schema parsing, libsqlz offers improved performance, making it suitable for high-performance applications.\n\n## Getting Started with libsqlz\n\nIntegrating libsqlz into your Zig project is straightforward. Begin by adding it as a dependency in your `build.zig` file:\n\n\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\npub fn build(b: *std.Build) void {\n    const target = b.standardTargetOptions(.{});\n    const optimize = b.standardOptimizeOption(.{});\n\n    // Your executable or library declaration...\n\n    const libsqlz = b.dependency(\"libsqlz\", .{\n        .target = target,\n        .optimize = optimize,\n    });\n\n    // Further build configurations...\n}\n```\n\n\nThis setup ensures that libsqlz is seamlessly integrated into your Zig project's build process.\n\n## Exploring libsqlz Through Examples\n\nConsider a scenario where you have a `users` table in your database. With libsqlz, you can define a corresponding Zig struct at compile time, ensuring that your code remains type-safe and closely aligned with your database schema.\n\n\n```zig\nconst libsqlz = @import(\"libsqlz\");\n\nconst User = struct {\n    id: i32,\n    name: []const u8,\n    email: []const u8,\n};\n```\n\n\nThis approach not only enhances type safety but also allows for compile-time checks, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.\n\n## The Journey Ahead\n\nDeveloping libsqlz has been a journey of exploration and innovation. As I continue to learn zig I am sure to refine its features and expand its capabilities, I invite fellow Zig developers to explore, contribute, and provide feedback.

This project facilitates seamless integration of Mathpix's Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities into Go applications, enabling the conversion of images containing mathematical expressions into LaTeX code.\n\n**Key Features of mathpix-go:**\n\n- **Image-to-LaTeX Conversion:** The library allows for the transformation of images with mathematical content into corresponding LaTeX representations, streamlining the process of digitizing complex equations.\n\n- **Batch Processing:** mathpix-go supports batch processing, enabling the submission of multiple images in a single request, which enhances efficiency when dealing with large datasets.\n\n- **Asynchronous Operations:** The library provides asynchronous processing capabilities, allowing applications to handle other tasks while awaiting the OCR results, thereby improving overall performance.\n\n**Installation:**\n\nTo incorporate mathpix-go into your Go project, execute:\n\n\n```bash\ngo get github.com/conneroisu/mathpix-go\n```\n\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nBelow is a basic example demonstrating how to use mathpix-go to convert an image containing a mathematical expression into LaTeX code:\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"context\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"os\"\n\n    \"github.com/conneroisu/mathpix-go\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    apiKey := \"your_api_key\"\n    appID := \"your_app_id\"\n\n    client := mathpix.NewClient(apiKey, appID)\n\n    imagePath := \"path_to_your_image.png\"\n    imageFile, err := os.Open(imagePath)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"failed to open image: %v\", err)\n    }\n    defer imageFile.Close()\n\n    request := &mathpix.ImageRequest{\n        Src: imageFile,\n    }\n\n    response, err := client.Image(context.Background(), request)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"failed to process image: %v\", err)\n    }\n\n    fmt.Println(\"LaTeX Code:\", response.Latex)\n}\n```\n\n\nIn this example, the `mathpix.NewClient` function initializes a new client with the provided API key and application ID. An image file is then opened and passed to the `Image` method of the client, which sends the image to the Mathpix API for processing. The resulting LaTeX code is printed to the console.\n\n**Development and Contribution:**\n\nmathpix-go is developed with a focus on performance and ease of use, aiming to provide Go developers with a straightforward means to integrate Mathpix's OCR capabilities into their applications. The project is open-source and licensed under the MIT License, encouraging community involvement and collaboration.\n\nFor more information, to explore the source code, or to contribute to the project, visit the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/conneroisu/mathpix-go](https://github.com/conneroisu/mathpix-go)\n\nBy developing mathpix-go, I aim to empower Go developers to seamlessly incorporate advanced OCR technology into their applications, facilitating the digitization and manipulation of complex mathematical content.\n",

More control over the types of outputs the model produces\n5. Greater flexibility in the types of inputs the model can accept\n6. The ability to produce more human-like outputs\n7. Increased accuracy in the prediction of certain types of outputs\n\nAn great resource for fine-tuning principles from [microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/prepare-dataset)\n\n# Usage\nThe core function of this plugin is made easier through the use of vim mode, but should work in either case. \nThere are two commands offered currently:(Each of these commands has an acommpanying hotkey configureable from hotkeys) \n\nWhen you send the prompt to the dataset if there is already a prompt there, the plugin does nothing. \n\nWhen you send the completion to the dataset and there is already a prompt the text selection is sent to the dataset as a completion to that prompt.\n\n## Open Ended Generation Support!\nWhen you send the completion to the dataset  and there is not a prompt, the text selection is inserted into the dataset with a empty prompt prepended to the text selection.\n\nan example of this \n```json\n{\"prompt\":\"\", \"completion\":\"Hello can I help you?\"}\n```\nanother example \n```json \n{\"prompt\":\"\", \"completion\":\"Hi, How can I help you today\"}\n```\n\nSend the Selection to send to your dataset file as prompt\nSend the Selection to send to your dataset file as completion\n\n\nExample of finetuning dataset\n```json\n{\"prompt\":\"Company: BHFF insurance\\nProduct: allround insurance\\nAd:One stop shop for all your insurance needs!\\nSupported:\", \"completion\":\" yes\"}\n{\"prompt\":\"Company: Loft conversion specialists\\nProduct: -\\nAd:Straight teeth in weeks!\\nSupported:\", \"completion\":\" no\"}\n```\n\n# Installation\n## Installing from the community plugins page in obsidian\n-   Open Settings > Third-party plugin\n-   Make sure Safe mode is\u00a0**off**\n-   Click Browse community plugins\n-   Search for \"Dataset Finetuning Aid Plugin\"\n-   Click Install\n-   Once installed, close the community plugins window and activate the newly installed plugin\n## Manually Installing from github \n-   Download the Latest Release from the Releases section of the GitHub Repository(if you can't find this it should be to the right while your viewing this)\n-   Extract the plugin folder from the zip to your vault's plugins folder:\u00a0`<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/`  \n    Note: On some machines the\u00a0`.obsidian`\u00a0folder may be hidden. On MacOS you should be able to press\u00a0`Command+Shift+Dot`\u00a0to show the folder in Finder.\n-   Reload Obsidian\n\n# Settings\nThere are four main settings that are configurable within the settings panel of the plugin, but the default values are set up for the popular format for datasets for text generation models called jsonl.\n\n| Setting Name          | Description                                                                     | Default       |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |\n| Prefix for Prompts    | This is the string that is prepended to the prompt when sent to the dataset     | `{\"prompt\":`    |\n| Suffix for Prompts    | This is the string that is appended to the prompt when sent to the dataset      | `,`             |\n| Prefix for Completion | This is the string that is prepended to the completion when sent to the dataset | `\"completion\":` |\n| Suffix for Completion | This is the string that is appended to the completion when sent to the dataset  | `}\\n`              |\n\n\n[Help within development](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-text-transporter/blob/main/src/features/transporterFunctions.ts)\n\n## Development \n\nCreating a new version:\n\n```bash\ngit tag -a 1.0.1 -m \"1.0.1\"\ngit push origin 1.0.1\n```\n# Inspiration\n\nInspired by the efficiency and appeal of fine-tuning your own language model, this plugin allows for you to build datasets from your notes in the form of prompts and responses. Automatically formats the text to the specification of\u00a0[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)\u00a0for finetuning models like GPT3.\n\nThis plugin shares simularities to the textTransporter Plugin made by [TfTHacker](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-text-transporter/)\n",

The repetitive tasks, the cumbersome code, and the constant battle to maintain efficiency were challenges I knew many developers faced. Determined to find a solution, I channeled my passion for coding and problem-solving into creating <strong>seltabl</strong>, a Go library designed to transform the way we interact with HTML tables.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-genesis-of-seltabl\"><a class=\"anchor permalink p-4\" href=\"#the-genesis-of-seltabl\">#</a> The Genesis of seltabl</h2>\n<p>The inception of seltabl was driven by a simple yet profound realization: extracting data from HTML tables shouldn't be a herculean task. As a senior in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Iowa State University, I had encountered numerous scenarios where the need for a streamlined, efficient method to parse HTML tables was evident. Leveraging the power of Go and inspired by the capabilities of the goquery library, I set out to develop a tool that would not only simplify the process but also offer configurability and robust developer support.</p>\n<h2 id=\"unveiling-seltabl\"><a class=\"anchor permalink p-4\" href=\"#unveiling-seltabl\">#</a> Unveiling seltabl</h2>\n<p>At its core, seltabl is a Go library accompanied by a command-line interface (CLI) and a language server. Its primary function is to parse HTML sequences into structs, making it particularly adept at handling HTML tables.

The repetitive tasks, the cumbersome code, and the constant battle to maintain efficiency were challenges I knew many developers faced. Determined to find a solution, I channeled my passion for coding and problem-solving into creating **seltabl**, a Go library designed to transform the way we interact with HTML tables.\n\n## The Genesis of seltabl\n\nThe inception of seltabl was driven by a simple yet profound realization: extracting data from HTML tables shouldn't be a herculean task. As a senior in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Iowa State University, I had encountered numerous scenarios where the need for a streamlined, efficient method to parse HTML tables was evident. Leveraging the power of Go and inspired by the capabilities of the goquery library, I set out to develop a tool that would not only simplify the process but also offer configurability and robust developer support.\n\n## Unveiling seltabl\n\nAt its core, seltabl is a Go library accompanied by a command-line interface (CLI) and a language server. Its primary function is to parse HTML sequences into structs, making it particularly adept at handling HTML tables. However, its versatility allows it to be employed for any HTML sequence parsing tasks. By enabling data binding to structs and providing a dynamic way to define table schemas, seltabl empowers developers to interact with web data more intuitively and efficiently.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Configurable Parsing:** seltabl allows for customizable parsing configurations, enabling developers to tailor the extraction process to their specific needs.\n  \n- **Goquery Integration:** By leveraging goquery, seltabl offers a familiar and powerful selection syntax, akin to jQuery, making it accessible for those already acquainted with CSS selectors.\n  \n- **Developer Tooling:** The inclusion of a language server and CLI utilities enhances the development experience, providing tools for code generation, linting, and testing.\n\n## Getting Started with seltabl\n\nIntegrating seltabl into your Go project is straightforward. Begin by installing the package:\n\n```bash\ngo get github.com/conneroisu/seltabl\n```\n\nFor access to the CLI and language server functionalities, install the command-line tool:\n\n```bash\ngo install github.com/conneroisu/seltabl/tools/seltabls@latest\n```\n\n## A Glimpse into Usage\n\nImagine you have an HTML table and you wish to extract its data into Go structs. With seltabl, this task becomes seamless. Here's a basic example:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"github.com/conneroisu/seltabl\"\n)\n\ntype TableRow struct {\n    Column1 string `json:\"column1\" hSel:\"tr:nth-child(1) td:nth-child(1)\" dSel:\"tr td:nth-child(1)\" ctl:\"text\"`\n    Column2 string `json:\"column2\" hSel:\"tr:nth-child(1) td:nth-child(2)\" dSel:\"tr td:nth-child(2)\" ctl:\"text\"`\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    htmlContent := `\n    <table>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Data1</td>\n            <td>Data2</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Data3</td>\n            <td>Data4</td>\n        </tr>\n    </table>\n    `\n    rows, err := seltabl.NewFromString[TableRow](htmlContent)\n    if err != nil {\n        panic(fmt.Errorf(\"failed to parse HTML: %w\", err))\n    }\n    for _, row := range rows {\n        fmt.Printf(\"%+v\\n\", row)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis snippet demonstrates how seltabl can be employed to parse an HTML table, extracting its contents into a slice of `TableRow` structs. The use of struct tags like `hSel`, `dSel`, and `ctl` allows for precise selection and extraction of data, showcasing the library's configurability.\n\n## The Road Ahead\n\nThe development of seltabl has been a journey of learning, innovation, and community engagement. As I continue to refine and expand its capabilities, I invite fellow developers to explore, contribute, and provide feedback. Together, we can make web data extraction in Go not just a necessity, but a delight.\n\nFor more information, detailed documentation, and contribution guidelines, visit the [seltabl GitHub repository](https://github.com/conneroisu/seltabl).

This project aims to enhance the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) and AI agents by providing a rapid decision-making layer that leverages semantic vector spaces for routing requests based on configurable semantic meanings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201</p>\n<p><strong>Key Features of semanticrouter-go:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Efficient Decision-Making:</strong> By utilizing semantic vector spaces, the library enables swift routing of requests, eliminating the latency associated with traditional LLM-generated decisions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pure Go Implementation:</strong> Written entirely in Go, semanticrouter-go ensures seamless integration into Go-based projects without external dependencies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flexible Encoding Support:</strong> The library supports various encoding methods, including integration with models like <code>mxbai-embed-large</code> through the Ollama API, facilitating versatile embedding strategies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Customizable Routing:</strong> Developers can define routes with specific utterances, allowing the router to match incoming queries to the most appropriate route based on semantic similarity.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Installation:</strong></p>\n<p>To incorporate semanticrouter-go into your Go project, execute:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"

Case:</strong></p>\n<p>Consider a scenario in a veterinary application where it's essential to distinguish between noteworthy medical inquiries and casual chitchat. semanticrouter-go can be configured to route user inputs accordingly:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;\"><code><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">package</span>

This project aims to enhance the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) and AI agents by providing a rapid decision-making layer that leverages semantic vector spaces for routing requests based on configurable semantic meanings. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n**Key Features of semanticrouter-go:**\n\n- **Efficient Decision-Making:** By utilizing semantic vector spaces, the library enables swift routing of requests, eliminating the latency associated with traditional LLM-generated decisions.\n\n- **Pure Go Implementation:** Written entirely in Go, semanticrouter-go ensures seamless integration into Go-based projects without external dependencies.\n\n- **Flexible Encoding Support:** The library supports various encoding methods, including integration with models like `mxbai-embed-large` through the Ollama API, facilitating versatile embedding strategies.\n\n- **Customizable Routing:** Developers can define routes with specific utterances, allowing the router to match incoming queries to the most appropriate route based on semantic similarity.\n\n**Installation:**\n\nTo incorporate semanticrouter-go into your Go project, execute:\n\n\n```bash\ngo get github.com/conneroisu/semanticrouter-go\n```\n\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\nConsider a scenario in a veterinary application where it's essential to distinguish between noteworthy medical inquiries and casual chitchat. semanticrouter-go can be configured to route user inputs accordingly:\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"os\"\n\n\t\"github.com/conneroisu/semanticrouter-go\"\n\t\"github.com/conneroisu/semanticrouter-go/encoders/ollama\"\n\t\"github.com/conneroisu/semanticrouter-go/stores/memory\"\n\t\"github.com/ollama/ollama/api\"\n)\n\nvar NoteworthyRoutes = semanticrouter.Route{\n\tName: \"noteworthy\",\n\tUtterances: []semanticrouter.Utterance{\n\t\t{Utterance: \"What is the best way to treat a dog with a cold?\"},\n\t\t{Utterance: \"My cat has been limping; what should I do?\"},\n\t},\n}\n\nvar ChitchatRoutes = semanticrouter.Route{\n\tName: \"chitchat\",\n\tUtterances: []semanticrouter.Utterance{\n\t\t{Utterance: \"What's your favorite color?\"},\n\t\t{Utterance: \"Do you like animals?\"},\n\t},\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tif err := run(); err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(err)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc run() error {\n\tctx := context.Background()\n\tcli, err := api.ClientFromEnvironment()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn fmt.Errorf(\"error creating client: %w\", err)\n\t}\n\trouter, err := semanticrouter.NewRouter(\n\t\t[]semanticrouter.Route{NoteworthyRoutes, ChitchatRoutes},\n\t\t&ollama.Encoder{\n\t\t\tClient: cli,\n\t\t\tModel:  \"mxbai-embed-large\",\n\t\t},\n\t\tmemory.NewStore(),\n\t)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn fmt.Errorf(\"error creating router: %w\", err)\n\t}\n\tfinding, p, err := router.Match(ctx, \"How's the weather today?\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n\t}\n\tfmt.Println(\"Found:\", finding.Name)\n\tfmt.Println(\"Probability:\", p)\n\treturn nil\n}\n```\n\n\nIn this example, the router evaluates the input \"How's the weather today?\" and classifies it under the \"chitchat\" route, demonstrating its ability to discern between different types of user interactions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n**Development and Contribution:**\n\nsemanticrouter-go is designed with a focus on performance and simplicity, aiming to provide developers with a tool to enhance AI decision-making processes efficiently.

Lua is often embedded in larger software applications, such as game engines like Unity and Corona, as well as networking and automation tools. Its small footprint and performance efficiency make it a popular choice for applications requiring fast execution and low resource consumption.\n",
